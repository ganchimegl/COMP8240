The well-known Midrash comes to mind.King Solomon applied his wisdom and prudence to help students find their way through the intricacies of the Torah.He was like the clever man in the parable of the large palace with many doors where a man would enter, become confused and not find the door by which he entered.The clever man took a clew of rope and suspended it by the door of entry so that it could serve as a guide to all who entered or came out."

0736693408,The First King of Shannara (The Sword of Shannara),,A1AX6VPDQQZDPV,M Carlton,4/4,5.0,1105574400,Great (what do you expect?),"This, like all of Brook's Shannara series books, is wonderful. I am glad that Brooks took the opportunity to write this prequel. It gives the reader a look into the past and into the characters and ancestors that started the story that continues through the Shannara series. The characters are very well developed and rich, without the droning on and on with descriptions that some authors fault. You learn little bits and pieces at a time about the characters and story that continually make you go ""Aha! So that's why....."" Moves along at a great pace and keeps you wondering, but with enough hints that you wait for the characters to find out if what you are anticipating is right! There are also plenty of ""I didn't see that coming"" moments. I recommend the entire SHANNARA SERIES for anybody who is looking for a wonderful fantastical world to read about. However, read this book in the order of publication - don't read it first."

0670569798,The Power and the Glory,,A319KYEIAZ3SON,Mary Whipple,1/1,5.0,1206576000,"""One mustn't have human affections--or rather one must love every soul as if it were one's own child.""","(4.5 stars) Graham Greene's most elaborate and personal examination of the good life--and the role of the Catholic church in teaching what the good life is--revolves around an unnamed ""whiskey priest"" in Mexico in the 1930s. Religious persecution is rife as secular rulers, wanting to bring about social change, blame the church for the country's ills. When the novel opens, the church, its priests, and all its symbols have been banned for the past eight years from a state near Veracruz. Priests have been expelled, murdered, or forced to renounce their callings. The whiskey priest, however, has stayed, bringing whatever solace he can to the poor who need him, while at the same time finding solace himself in the bottle.Constantly on the move, the priest suffers agonizing conflicts. His sense of guilt for the past includes a brief romantic interlude which has produced a child, and though he recognizes that he is often weak, selfish, and fearful, he still tries to bring comfort to the faithful. Pursued by a police lieutenant who believes that justice for all can only occur if the church is destroyed, and by a mestizo, who is seeking the substantial reward for turning him in, the desperate priest finally decides to escape to a nearby state in which religion is not banned so that the police will stop killing hostages taken in the villages he has visited.The police pursuit of the priest is paralleled by their pursuit of a ""gringo"" murderer, a man so base that he thinks nothing of murdering children, yet the priest even sees value in this man's life, and when the gringo, the mestizo, the lieutenant, and the priest finally come together, Greene's philosophical and religious analysis reaches its climax. For all their faults, the priest is often heroic, the murdering gringo still has a soul worth saving, the mestizo (a Judas figure) offers the priest a better chance to see God, and the lieutenant eventually sees the priest as a human, not simply as a symbol.Greene's novel is beautifully constructed--intricate, filled with symbols and parallels, yet often sensitive and moving. Though the action moves through an almost unremittingly bleak landscape and the sense of dread is positively palpable throughout, the novel eventually reveals the ""power"" and the ""glory"" of faith. In this sense, the novel is as much a philosophical and religious tract--specifically an examination of the Catholic faith--as it is a human story. While some may find the novel dogmatic and the priest's agonized self-examination sometimes tedious, others will find the novel uplifting and inspiring. n Mary WhippleThe Third ManOur Man in Havana: An Entertainment (Twentieth Century Classics)The Human Factor (Everyman's Library Classics)"

B000GRDY1O,VOICES OF HOPE - Signed,,A2X86K2EZCV0U1,"SouthernFried ""southernfried""",5/6,4.0,1042156800,This is the one I remember.,"After reading the series through Patriarch's Hope, I reflected back on them all, and this book is the one that stuck with me. It's been awhile since I read it, but, since it's the one that I remember most, I felt I should write a review.It is a completely original storyline. The introduction of new characters from Pook and Changman of the trannies, to Seafort's brilliant son, Phillip, really added new dimension to the series. I needed a break from Seafort and his guilt trip, this did it.Seaforts' son, Phillip, chases after his freind into the streets of NY. The only people living on the streets now are ""trannies"". These people are the forgotten throwaway's of a society that has since moved onward and upward into the skyscrapers and away from the city. Only heavily armed patrols ever venture into the streets, and then, only if absolutely necessary. Basically, the streets are left alone and ignored, and barred from the rest of the ""civilized"" world. Once there, your on your own...and don't expect any help, cuz it aint coming.It's into this world that Phillip now finds himself...and it's a fascinating world. There are gangs, and subcultures that have arisen out of survival instincts. How they exist together, and the society they have developed, knowing that no one gives a damn about them, is remarkable. There is ingenuity, violence, power grabs, treaties, bravery, and a surprisingly large amount of humor...probably not enough love, but, it is there also. It's a darwinian survival of the fittest society...and it's damned interesting.Phillips obvious genius, coupled with some handy martial arts instruction he had as a child, helps him survive in this environment. He meets up with Changman, a ""neutral"" trader, who trades with all the gangs equally...so as not to piss of any in particular. Changman is the real interesting character in this story. He has many secrets, and is one of the more multi-dimensional personalities in the HOPE series. Pook, is a child tranny, who Changman tries to look out for the best he can. There is no overt emotion or physical show of love and affection between the two. But, as much as the streets will allow, Changman tries to do his best for the kid.Pook is a great character also. A typical street ""tough"" wannabe. Just a child really, but, he wants to be feared and respected. His feelings and emotions can sometimes be hilarious as he's figuring out how to be tough, especially when this ""uppie"" kid just kicked his butt. He's as street smart a kid as your gonna find in any story tho...and you gotta love him.As for the ""TRANNY LANGUAGE"" everyone seems to be lambasting. I think that was as important to the story as any of the characters. The more I read it, the more I followed it. Along with Phillip and other ""uppies."" We all learned it together. It is an extremely expressive slang. That matches the conditions of the trannies perfectly. They wouldn't be Trannies if they didn't have this language. The book wouldn't have been what it was without it. I had no problem following it, and the more I read, the more descriptive I found the language to be. It's just slang, after all, not French :-). Because of how well this language was used and flushed out, it seemed totally natural and part of this world. I think the TRANNY LANGUAGE is one of Feintuch's best acheivements as an author.There is a hilarious review using the Tranny language below mine, I think its completely understandable, and the more you read it, the less you have to think about it. I think they key, is to not think too much about it, and just lightly read over it, the meaning becomes clear. Almost every time POOK talks, using Tranny speak...I smile.Anyway, its a fascinating book, and the best in the series, imho. Those that didn't like it, seemed to have a common problem with it...the Tranny language. I didn't have that problem and thought it was one of the best aspects of the book.I think this could be a stand alone book. It's been over a year since I read it...but, its so different, and the characters are almost all new, you probably don't need to read the previous Hope books to enjoy it. It's amazing I remember as much of it as I do. I have difficulty remembering the TITLES of the other books in the series, let alone any story line. Yes, I recommend this one.SF"
0385249373,Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality,10.19,,,8/8,5.0,924048000,This book will help even the helpless,"You can't go wrong with this book. First, it's easy to read. Second, it's relatively short. In fact, it impresses me as to how much he was able to say in such a short book. I mean, Neale Donald Walsh needed 3 books (conversations with God) to basically say similar stuff. The chapters are also short. This makes repeating a few chapters painless. In fact, I repeated the whole book now twice.You will probably find yourself underlining many passages that you will re-read often and share with others. One that particularly felt good to me was: &quot;Happiness is our natural state. Happiness is the natural state of little children, to whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the stupidity of society and culture&quot;As you probably know, Anthony De Mello died in 1987. I am sure that his death is probably atributed to; he just plain felt like doing so, and let that be it, so it was good....."
B000NWB5L8,Of Mice and Men,,A12YHRKLVF9AAC,"""too_cool""",1/1,5.0,952473600,A truely great book,"This was a great book. I enjoyed it from the front cover to the back. Steinbeck's desriptions made you pity the characters you were suppossed to, and hate the characters you were supposed to hate. It's not difficult to read, and the ending was a real shocker. Another thing I like are the hints that Steinbeck drops to foreshadow the futures. There are two events which mirror each other, except for the fact that they are between completely different characters. I won't say what it is, because it will give stuff away. So, all in all, it's a great book, and really deserves to be read."
0774032448,Hamlet,,A1JLKPA3EPLFCP,Ashareh,1/1,5.0,990748800,Good stuff,"This edition of Hamlet, with its accompanying critical essays is a good introduction to literary theory (in fact, my lit interpretation professor used it as exactly that). Wofford's essay on the critical history of Hamlet is clear and concise, with an interesting focus on the performance of the play. The critical essays' perspectives include feminist and Marxist theory."

Something I dislike about the plot is that there are a couple of characters actions that come off as very contrived, mostly I find it hard to believe that the main character would share so little information with his companions about the antagonist, leading them to make unbelievably stupid decisions.On the other hand, I think there is a bit of romance blossoming here and there, and it is refreshingly not cheesy, as there is no love at first sight, and he does not go on to describe women's breasts everytime one appears in a scene, things of that nature. And so far no disturbingly violent things have made me cringe like in A Song of Ice and Fire.My biggest complaint is that this does not seem to be a trilogy. It is a prequel to a trilogy. Am I the only one confused by the title? I feel kind of ripped off for $8, but I guess I should read the description more carefully next time."
B0008A3964,The First Part Of King Henry The Fourth (The Yale Shakespeare),,A2STAUT07F8VRR,Scout1980,5/5,5.0,1091059200,The two sides of Hal,"Henry IV remains one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, even though the tragedies and comedies get far more attention and seeming appreciation than do the histories. As an English major, I examined Henry's (Hal's) character, and I focused on his development from a somewhat foolhardy young man into a self-assured, even manipulative prince. It is hard to say which of these Hal truly is, or if he is a little bit of both.At the beginning of the play, Hal spends his free time cavorting around with his friend Falstaff (who provides all of the laughs in the play and is cited as one of the best comic characters in all literature). In the first act we already see hints in Hal's sololiquy that he may not be as carefree as we are led to believe, and that he might betray friends like Falstaff to be the prince that he is expected to be. Read on in &quot;Henry V&quot; to see just how much of a polished politician Hal becomes--his battle cries and his &quot;once more unto the breech, dear friends&quot; is masterful in its persuasiveness and ability to induce his countrymen to fight.Hotspur serves as a nice counterpoint to Hal in &quot;Henry IV.&quot; Hotspur is the hothead and Hal makes his decisions calmly and rationally. This almost inhuman rationality comes into play again in &quot;Henry V&quot; and makes you long for the seemingly carefree Hal.All in all, &quot;Henry IV&quot; is a great read and quite an interesting character study--I highly recommend it!"

1887368566,Right to Life: And 2 New Stories,11.53,A2TTPQ1YEKUL0D,"Kim Muller ""Kim""",1/4,4.0,1197676800,Frightening and Thought-Provoking,"I just finished reading this novella, and it's the second of Ketchum's books that I have read. Let me begin by saying that I did NOT want to read this book. As a new mother, I felt that it would just be too graphic and too horrifying, yet after reading about 1/3 of it, I began to realize that Ketchum led me gently and concerned into this novella.Sara Foster is a very realistic picture of a sad woman who somewhat fell into an affair with a married man, and an abortion becomes her decision. When she is kidnapped by the psychotic couple, her external and internal struggles are so well-written without extremely gory or unrealistic details. This keeps the reader from suspension of disbelief, which strengthens the connection to Sara. I know a reviewer commented on the somewhat unbelievable circumstances of her treatment since the woman who holds Sara is a nurse, but if you have read Peaceable Kingdom, this woman isn't exactly a well-qualified nurse for anyone.If Right to Life made me appreciate Jack Ketchum, Brave Girl made me appreciate a child. This story and its sudden twist showed me an old gruesome difference between a young child and an adult, and I am sure nearly every reader of it would say the same."

The family joins together in their efforts to make everything perfect for their special visitor. When the mother is too busy to do it herself, she asks her family, one person at a time, to add some pepper to the pot of stew. When each of them say they can't, she asks yet another to put pepper in the stew. Eventually, when they each find the time, they all add a little pepper, some more than others. Unbeknownst to each other, they have inadvertantly added so much pepper that the stew is rendered inedible.

I was simultaneously excited (that a third novel was in the works) and disappointed (that the novel was not scheduled to print until Summer 2007). In January, I read that it was scheduled for the April 2006 release, much to my happiness, and pre-ordered the novel and received it this past Friday. I decided to refresh my memory and ended up reading the entire series over this past weekend and finished this third portion of the series (Trilogy? I hope hope hope there's more!) a little less than ten minutes ago. I would advise rereading the first two installments...now, on to the actual review:I'll be honest with you, ""Charmed Thirds"" was not exactly what I expected. I was more or less thrilled at the prospect of delving deep into the Marcus-Jessica relationship and the mushy-gushy nonsense that I so desperately long for in my own life. However, the novel is much more realistic in that the relationship isn't perfect and (gasp!) doesn't last the length of the book. It instead explores other relationships (or lack thereof) Jessica becomes involved in, many involving drunken sexual encounters. Someone mentioned earlier that this is a fault, but I can assure that, being a college student myself, I know that my peers are very much engaged in such activities on a week-endly (if not nightly) basis. It is sad but true, much like the uncensored version of Jessica's foul mouth, which whether you want to believe it or not.The difference is the sharp-wit which is enhanced by a more mature (but not overly so) outlook than the previous journals. I laughed out loud so often that I had the urge (but resisted) to copy down several quotes throughout the book. It is overall,lighthearted, but holds a good message that most people need to hear: LIVE!"

Lennie, is best put as retarded, but is really the nicest guy in the world: it is just his size that interfears with the two men's lives. George has a short fussed temper and Lennie can't help but be dumb when it comes to any situation they may find themsleves in. The book has a great plot that you have to stop and think about long after you have put the book down, and this is without a doubt, the most realistic novel I have ever read. I would suggest reading this at a MATURE high school level. If you are too young for this book, you will not understand it. If you do understand it, you will see what a great novel it really is."

B000GRORC4,The Color of Magic,,A1I2O9Y3X3HXLS,Arthur W. Jordin,4/5,5.0,1059091200,A Funny Foursome,"The Colour of Magic (1983) is the first volume in the Discworld series. Somewhere there is a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin, swimming through space. Atop the turtle are four enormous elephants -- Berilia, Tubul, Great T'Phon and Jerakeen-- holding up a huge disk that is the world. A moon and miniature sun orbit around this odd grouping. This initial volume contains four novelettes depicting the zany characters and amazing sights of the Discworld. It features Rincewind the [failed] wizard, Twoflower the Tourist, and the Luggage (also called reflected-sound-as-of-underground-spirits, but who wants to say that every time). Rincewind is best known for his ability to run very fast and very often; he is terrified of almost everything. Twoflower is the first and only tourist on Discworld (Rincewind is not sure what the word tourist means, but he suspects it means idiot). The Luggage is a box with many small legs, infinite storage space, strange powers, and a vicious temper.In The Colour of Magic, Morpork is burning and the brave citizens of Ankh are demolishing the connecting bridges. Bravd the Hublander and Weasel watch from a cool hilltop a few miles away. They see two mounted men and some kind of low beast coming out of the city; the men are Rincewind, who suffers from an overdose of terror, and Twoflower, who had started the fire. They are accompanied by the Luggage.In The Sending of Eight, Blind Io and the other gods are playing a game with a board full of modeled pieces representing Bravd, Weasel and other heroes and champions. Lady is down to only Rincewind and Twoflower. Blind Io rolls three fives, but Lady rolls a six, a three and a seven.In The Lure of the Wyrm, Rincewind, Twoflower, Hrun the Barbarian, and the Luggage encounter Liessa Wyrmbidder of Wyrmberg. Liessa wants a man to be her consort and she selects Hrun. However, Rincewind discovers the magic sword Kring embedded in a tree branch, pulls it free, and finds himself learning how to be a [reluctant] hero as the sword plans a rescue of the kidnapped Hrun.In Close to the Edge, Rincewind and Twoflower visit the Rimfall, where the ocean falls off the Discworld, and see the Rimbow. They almost fall off the Edge, but are caught in a strong net. Unfortunately, they are then found by the troll who patrols that section of the Circumference for the salvage fleet.This initial volume introduces the Discworld series. It also initiates the use of irreverent footnotes which are often funnier than the main text. The following volumes, however, expand in all sorts of directions. Some also feature Rincewind, but others include the [mostly competent] wizards of Unseen University, the night watch, the witches, the dwarves, Lord Vetinari, Death, and many more.Highly recommended to Pratchett fans and anyone else who enjoys dry humor in an exotic (and totally unbelievable) setting.-Arthur W.

Certainly many of his thoughts are conjecture and subject to further disproval by advancements in science, technology and research, but I dont know that any discoveries will totally invalidate his conclusions, just potentially put a finer tip on some of his fuzzier theories."

No one should go through life without at least giving this book a shot.In this novel J.R.R. Tolkien pens the archetypal adventure for the modern world, complete with memorable characters, a rich world, and a good amount of danger. The story, although sometimes touted as a book for young people, is perfectly acceptable for adults as well. Regardless of age, this is one of the few reads which will truly engross you from the first page to the last.Do yourself a favor: buy your kid a copy. Buy yourself a copy. This is a book every amateur adventurer should read at least once."

One of my favourite part was when catherine was deciding whether or not to marry linton and had explained what heathcliff meant to her to her housekeeper. My favourite quotes from that part: ""my great miseries in life has been heathcliff's"", ""he is more than myself than i am"" and my favourite which was mentioned in eclipse, ""if all else perished and he remains, i should still continue to be. but if all else remained and he were anihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger""Another favourite part was when both of them were reunited before catherine died. there was a speck of humanity in them when they were reunited and you somehow forget how horrible they were.Another favourite part was when heathcliff learned that catherine died and the way he handled the news, it was devastating and for that moment, i feel sad for him and again, forget for a moment of how rude and vicious his character is. that one small paragraph was a mix of love and grieve all together which was written with so much power that I had to stop reading for a minute to digest it.the story is mostly about the consequences of the love between catherine and heathcliff..their love affected a lot of people and i guess it shows the dark side of love and obsession."

Well, I have it now, and what a disappointment it is!To be brief: Mr. Clancy is getting old and grumpy and uses his writing to express his rather boring, old fashioned and conservative political ideas. This must even be a bore for any US reader, but for an international reader it's like reading a 1100 page column in a local small town USA newspaper.Oh, by the way, this book actually features a story somewhere between the lines.

Perhaps because I read it as a fairy tale. A wonderfully romantic fairy tale. With magic, good over evil, and living happily ever after.I can understand one of the criticisms. The characters in the story did seem a bit flat. It felt to me that we weren&#65533;t given much time in the character&#65533;s heads; how they thought about things etc. But the relationships, within the context of the story, still seemed totally believable and endearing to me. Another criticism in the reviews I read was that the two story lines seemed disjointed. I have to disagree. I will admit, the first time the story switched to &#65533;Sometime Else&#65533;, I found it distracting and didn&#65533;t know what was going on. But then as the story progressed, the stories were drawn closer and closer together, and more relevant to each other, to the point of a complete connection at the end.And the story of The Prince and Brecia was WONDERFUL! I would LOVE to see an entire book dedicated just to them!This is a unique and fun story. I&#65533;ve read over 200 romance novels and consider this to be one of my favorites."

The children try to cope with their mother's depression, alcohol abuse and a dysfunctional family.When the mother decides she needs time to get herself together, they are passed on to their father and his new wife. This situation presents a different type of struggle: ultimately the children are placed in the foster care system. Lenora and Harry Jr. are passed through one house to another, facing physical abuse, sexual abuse and separation from each other.The book introduces us to these families and the other children in their care while opening our eyes to the foster care system. This is a sometimes heartbreaking book, but yet it is so riveting you cannot put it down.Armchair says: Survival Of The Fittest is the story of one woman's triumph over the circumstances that life has handed her, making Lenora's story one you cannot forget."
B0006E4RYA,Soldiers of fortune (The Epic of flight),,A3F0AFTVKFAMZZ,Marvin D. Pipher,4/4,3.0,1188777600,The adventures of those fliers for whom the price was right . . .,"This is one of a series of books, by Time Life, which explores the history of aviation from its earliest stages up to the jet age (circa 1981). This particular volume presents a portion of that history from the standpoint of those who volunteered their services, generally for high pay, to fly for foreign powers, most often in secret and under extremely hazardous conditions. Their story is presented in five chapters. The first covers the early days; the second, the Spanish Civil War; the third, ""The Flying Tigers;"" the fourth, what the book terms ""an airborne knight-errant;"" and the fifth, the broader war in Southeast Asia which led to and culminated with the end of the Vietnam War.I bought this book primarily because of the chapter about the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better known as the Flying Tigers. That chapter intrigued me but, based on the book's title I also I hoped to learn a little more about the Lafayette Escadrille. In both regards, I was, somewhat disappointed. Surprisingly, little was said about the Lafayette Escadrille, and, for some inexplicable reason, the chapter on the Flying Tigers seemed to concentrate on the adventures of Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, who, based on everything I've ever read, was one of the AVG's lesser lights. To make matters worse, much that was said about Boyington didn't quite agree with what I thought I already knew.The rest of the book, however, was very interesting and quite informative. I learned a lot of history, particularly about the Spanish Civil War and the events leading up to the Vietnam War. I also learned what Claire Chenault did after his AVG folded and World War II came to an end. I also encountered some very interesting and unusual flyers about whom I previously knew nothing. The most interesting of these was the subject of Chapter 4, Sweden's Count Carl Gustave von Rosen, a man who always tried to fly for the right cause and who, unlike his fellow mercenaries, charged only a nominal wage and if the need arose would serve at his own expense. It's sad that Rosen met such a cruel end, but one can hope that he is remembered and recognized in Sweden for the hero he was in life.As for the book: I would recommend it to anyone interested in aviation history, especially history told from the perspective of those few aviation adventurers who were willing to put their lives on the line for someone else's cause (as long as the price was right)."

1588465845,Mage the Awakening DELUXE SCREEN,,A31QYFL810FAW,B. Schenck,7/7,4.0,1130112000,Excellent product,"I think that the Storyteller's Screens put out by White Wolf have only done nothing but improve over time. In year's past, the screens were slightly flexible and not nearly as sturdy as they should have been, and not nearly as nice looking as they could have been. This one is definitely nicely done.Firstly, the screen itself is made of the same material as the hardcover books you buy from White Wolf. In and of itself, this is a huge leap forward, as the screen is about as sturdy as you can get, at the same time being easily folded up for transportation. It's also a nicely sized screen, covering plenty of area that you want to obscure. And the cover itself is very similar to the designs and patterns on the Mage book.The screen has plenty of information from the original WoD book (so you don't need to have it open all the time), as well as plenty of material from the Mage book itself. Definitely something that makes it a bit easier on the spines of those hardcover books (which is a shame to damage in the case of the very beautiful looking Mage book). In some respects, it's almost too packed, as there is literally information all over the 4 folding sections of the screen. So, you definitely get what you paid for.Which is really my only complaint; the screen is almost too full of information. So, it can be hard to find stuff as there's a lot up there. The large type face makes things fairly easy to find, but it still has a lot all over the sections facing the Storyteller. Many might find this a hard complaint, as the more information available at a glance the better... But there's always some little bit of less referenced information that can be left off.Still, all in all, it's an excellent piece of work. For the $14 or so price, it's worth it."

Whereas ""East of Eden"" or ""Of Mice and Men"" provide the reader with beautifully rich characters wrapped in poetic narrative, ""The Winter of Our Discontent"" offers an expanded cast encased in a comparatively mediocre prose.Ethan Hawley--grocery store clerk, heir of a small town American legacy, father, husband, and friend--is the books sole intriguing character. Tempted by greed, lust, violence, and crime--through which he skates unscathed-- Ethan's struggles lead to his near suicide which is prevented by love for his daughter and a desire to see his name thrive.Ethan's relationship with and attitude toward his children is where this story shines. This alone makes it a novel worth reading. He is brutal in pointing out his children's flaws, but constant in his love and devotion towards them.Overall, not my favorite Steinbeck, but it was surely interesting. The few brilliantly poetic sentences interspersed in passable prose kept me reading.Yes, I will deign to give this book a completely subjective letter grade: B+."

Philosophy is not written in a vacuum, nor do philosophers live in white towers; by describing the lives of these men and revealing their attitudes as well as their principles, one can better understand the impetus and force their particular philosophical approach took. Their individual philosophy lends itself to a self jusitification of their living, and, for whatever merit their rationalization has, it can hardly be separated from their everyday concrete experiences. Though brilliant in thought, nevertheless, their psychology and desires are more often served by their philosophys than not. And as a result what can be said is that we can ""see"" a reason for a Feuerbach, a Nietzsche, a Marx or Comte, but there is no reason to be a Feuerbachian, a Nietzschian, a Marxist or Comtean."

Among his patients is the Balise family - Mr. & Mrs. Balise and their three daughters Cecile, Clarisse and Madeline (Madou). When Philippe would call on the Balises he would invariably be invited to supper with them, and actually looked forward to dining with the family whenever he could. Philippe counted among his close friends the Balise's daughter Madou. After the meal they would go for a walk, and just talk about anything.Mr. & Mrs. Balise confided to Philippe that they were concerned about Madou going to visit a Wild West show after dinner each evening. They thought she was getting too involved with a certain Native American named Choice. Philippe accompanied Madou after dinner to meet Choice who did not speak French, but had no problem making known what he wanted to say to Madou.When the show left Paris, Choice did not leave. Madou moved him into the Balise's apartment, and he became ill almost immediately. Philippe could not discern what was causing the problem, and decided to take Choice to the mountains. They wanted to see if the wide open space was what he was pining for. Madou told Philippe that when Choice got better that she was going to accompany him back to America. This news greatly disturbed Philippe. The time in the mountains seemed to help Choice, but after arriving back in Paris he fell ill again.Philippe asked one of his doctor friends to come and see if he could determine what was making Choice ill. Around this time another Wild West show came to town, which happened to be one Choice had once been associated. Madou contacted the show and found a friend of Choice's, learning that his name was indeed Black Elk. Madou gathered enough money to send Black Elk home again; she however, stayed in Paris.The story shows the friendship between a doctor and his patients, and the relationship each memorable character had with each other, and with Black Elk. Mrs. Balise worried about having Black Elk in her home and what the neighbors would say, while for Madou, it was the most natural thing in the world to have him stay there. The friendship and ultimate marriage of Philippe and Madou is almost an afterthought to the story.Friendship, compassion and love abound in this delightful story of two men and one woman.Received book free of charge."

It has stood the test of time very well. However, it is disappointing to see that many of the inequities of David Champlin's life still exist 45 years later.

It was such a creative idea that you meet five people in heaven that tell you about your life and why things happened as they did. Maybe my expectations were too high but I did not enjoy the book. The book jumped around a lot from past to present. Many of the scenarios presented in the past were uninformative and not necessary to the plot or character development. The focus was mostly on the main character, Eddie, and his actual life and not his afterlife. The sections on his afterlife were brief and very disappointing. I was expecting some profound words about life and life's lessons but the author's take on the meaning of Eddie's life was a disappointment. I finished reading the book only out of curiosity as to why others found the book interesting, and in hopes that it would get better. I would not recommend this book for it did not captivate me nor cause me to think."

From the moment he steps into the ward McMurphy is trying to lighten the spirits of the inmates. He starts off small by greeting everyone in the room when he first arrives, but he does not stop there. He continues his crusade by sticking up for individuals in group sessions and by gaining privileges such as the tub room and a basketball team. Why does McMurphy go out of his way to give the inmates a sense of freedom? McMurphy has plenty to lose when he invokes the Big Nurse's wrath. Not only can he be sent to the Disturbed Ward, but he can also receive shock therapy or be sentenced to additional time in the mental institution.The novel is told from the perspective of Bromden, a half Indian patient who pretends to be deaf and dumb. The patients of his ward have slipped away from themselves and into routine. When McMurphy is brought to the mental asylum the Big Nurse's ward is turned inside out. After sometime the patients warm up to this interesting Irishman and their lives are changed forever through their escapades.This is a great novel. I love Kesey's portrayal of the metal ward from the ""Chief's"" perspective. Kesey's style allowed me to relate to a group of people that I would normally have trouble identifying myself with. I enjoyed this book completely from cover-to-cover. I am extremely glad I read this novel; I just wish I had done it sooner. I enjoyed the novel so much that I would never consider watching the movie. Although I have heard a great deal about the movie I do not think I would ever watch it. I doubt that any performance could ever do my image of the crazy Irishman and the tall ""Chief"" justice."

One can definitely finishes it over a weekend. It gives the reader brief history of Mormons. In addition to the comments by my fellow reviewers, I would like to add:1. The brothers have the fundamental belief and from the description of the book, pratice some kind of religious meditation that gives them the &quot;revealation&quot;. This is the most dangerous part of meditation, IMHO. For as far as I know, no decent buddhist student are allowed to have religious meditation without a guidance of a buddhism master. Some of students may need to stay with the master for 10 years until the master finally &quot;admit&quot; one as student. So, an ad hoc group like those groups in this book are really dangerous without a formal guidance.2. The author clearly is a not friend of Mormon but I will say he makes his disposition fair &amp; square with little moral judgement.3. I wonder how does a Christian solve the problem of faith in the scripture and the real life. Clearly, most people now abhor polygamy and surely, the main stream (reluctantly, as described in this book) dropped the teaching of polygamy. However, the scripture has implicitly say it and the prophet, Joseph Smith, did practice it.... The bible asked people to stone a woman ifshe commits adultery. Will a Christian really stone a woman? But, it is against the temporal law in most country. So, what is the truth? How could you tell this we should which but that we shouldn't?"

But, with all of the positive comments that were on the book's cover it had to be good.Actually, it was better! I literally could not put the book down. I got it just before Thanksgiving and finished it with in 3 days.The plot is quite involved. Just when you think you have things figured out, there's a new twist. I don't want to give details of the plot as it will ruin the surprise of discovering the twists: just know they are there and that it makes for a fun read. One of the things that I liked about the main plot was it was so believeable. In fact, I heard about this book while watching the author, Joel C. Rosenberg interviewed on Hannity and Colmes. I heard Joel say that while writing the book, 9-11 hit and he had to do some adjusting to the plot due to how real his initial premise was to what had just occurred.The characters become your friends, just as in any good book. I liked the character development, much like a Tom Clancy novel, in that the reader seems to be drawn into a world of reality that most of us only see from the outside. How do they set up security boundaries for Presidential motorcades? How do they draw information out of a suspect that may be reluctant to talk? I have wondered about that very thing while hearing of some of the information drawn out of the actual Taliban prisoners held in Cuba. How do they get these ""loyal"" Taliban top aides to talk? I got an idea of how it might be done in Chapter 5...All in all this was one terrific read. If the first chapter doesn't get you hooked, then have a Urologist check out your adrenal glands. For the rest of us, lay off the caffeine. This book is a good substitute.My only complaint: It'll take Joel C. Rosenberg at least a couple of years to pound out another book..."

Yet, we must read it if we are in an English Literature survey course.It is ponderous going... a classic of dreary proportions, encumbered by a depressing plot, set in dismal surroundings and peopled by dysfunctional characters.However, many other readers, many teachers and professors, many literature critics, genuinely love this book.- Perhaps it appeals to their current mood, or it speaks to having shared, in some way, the experience of one or another of the characters?- Perhaps they have loved long and deeply and found their love unfulfilled? Then Heathcliff speaks to their hearts.- Perhaps they have moved beyond a deeply felt love, for reasons that they cannot fully express or understand, all the while, still keeping deep in some hidden recess of their psyche, that love that will remain first or best or purest? We can see, then, why that reader might be drawn to identify with Cathy.A sad aspect of the book, however, is that it seems so hopeless, so dark, so fatalistic, so depressing. An over identification with these characters might have an adverse effect on a susceptible reader.The reality is, if you are more or less happy in who you are and who the other beloved people in your life may be, then you will probably find very few connecting points with these benighted main characters. If so, I will offer you this hint......Watch the DVD of Larry Olivier and Merle Oberon, dear student, before you read. They play fast and loose with the plot, so you still have to read the book to ace your test or write your essay. But at least you will have some visual hints of beauty to keep in mind as you labor with this challenging novel.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."

I recommend that before you read this Manga you become fairly well acquainted with the Sailor Moon series as the TV show has only gotten through Sailor Moon R in the U.S. and this book assumes that you know the characters from the beginning. The only real problems with the book are in the translation to English as some key names were mixed up and some of the storyline is a bit garbled in a very difficult translation between two languages that do not work well together.

B0007DWEOU,"The Screwtape letters,",,AANVQ29G6GVA8,Z. Phoenix,3/3,5.0,1158710400,A must-read classic of the 20th century.,"C.S. Lewis is clearly one of the masters of 20th century prose. His theological ideas are very succulent in their purpose and while I may not agree with every doctrinal belief of his, the essence of his message is a very pure one - fulfilment comes only from submitting your will to the Father, through loyal service, dedication, and love (which He very happily returns to you in limitless abounds).""The Screwtape Letters"" is a collection of epistles from the senior devil Screwtape to his junior 'tempter-in-training' nephew, Wormwood. The contents of Scewtape's letters are various discourses on how to spiritually influence the tempter's human ""patient"" into staying as far away from God as possible.Through this devil's advocate style of writing, we are given a very interesting glimpse into the workings of the evil one and how he can gradually pull people away from the Father through subtle tactical advances.Many times through reading Screwtape's letters as he discussed the behaviour of Wormwood's patient, I would have to stop myself and think, ""Wow, I have acted exactly the same in that situation before"" and Lewis begins to open up your perception of your own behaviour with an accurate objective commentary of our human thought processes - and the way in which they can be turned against us, e.g. how realising one's own humility can easily turn into a form of spiritual pride.Most surprisingly, was a passage where Screwtape discusses how God's only desire is for every human being to become exactly as his Son is, to the point where they realise that they are themselves sons and daughters of God. Lewis definitely understands the very core of Jesus' teachings, no matter how much Christianity has corrupted them over the years.Fiction-wise, all of the characters mentioned are given to us in brief glimpses at different times in the book, to the point where while there may not be large amounts of detail on them all, you could give a good description of each at the end of reading the entire book.Some of the more ""story"" focused elements are quite fun, and give us a glimpse into the 'mythos' that Lewis has obviously given some thought to before writing the ""Letters"". While some events are quite enjoyable, even humorous at times (such as when Screwtape's momentary anger causes him to involuntarily transform into a giant centipede) I felt slightly disappointed that there weren't more plot elements or details of this demonic ""world"" that Lewis' characters live in - although perhaps this was to preserve the authentic tone of the letters and the fluidity with which the book progresses.Overall, some passages touched me so deeply that I would have to ponder on them for some time before continuing on. I must admit that some of Lewis' ideas were so profound; they went over my head completely (I'm only 17 and have no qualms about admitting that I still have much more to learn, spiritually and intellectually). I hope that with future re-readings of this book (which for me, there most definitely will be!) I will pick up on things I had missed last time and, with hope, have a few more moments of inspired revelation.This is most definitely a classic which should be read by everyone, religious or not. It will open up your mind to many philosophical ideas about the nature of human beings and the psychological way in which we perceive spirituality.For those looking purely for a fictional reading experience, this one may be a little scant on details to satisfy your curiosity.I have no hesitations in recommending this book with a stellar 5/5 stars."

The series starts out with Rayford Steele a Airline pilot flying a routine flight when 80% of his crew and passengers disappear. This is teh rapture. All i can say is that from their the story is amazing. I was a non christin and i still have issues that keep me form coming a die hard christin. I do believe in god, and the rapture but do not believe certain things in the bible. This book on a non christian level opens the mind to the possiblity of the rapture actually occuring and hell even if you dont really believe it makes for a great fictionious novel. On a christian level the meaning and truth of this series is there. All i can say is give this book a chance, and dont read it with a closed mind. If i picked it up expecting another lame &quot;bible&quot; based book i would have hated it. But it was read with intuition and curiousity that just made it exciting.

Delenda est Carthago!&quot;(&quot;Carthage must be destroyed!&quot;) were some of the best-remembered words of Marcus Porcius Cato, a senator of Rome during the second century BC. He got his wish at the end of the Third Punic War, when Carthage effectively ceased to exist. I used to feel a certain sympathy for the Carthaginians. Then I read Salammbo.I first encountered this novel at the impressionable age of 13, and had no idea what to make of it. I had to gain a lot more knowledge (and cynicism) before I could approach it with anything but nausea. It is not a pretty book, nor do the actions of the protagonists make much sense, until one takes them in the context of Flaubert. He did do a good deal of historical research, but he was, as A.J. Krailsheimer points out in the introduction, also an enthusiastic student of de Sade. This novel is not simply about violence (although the reader will need hip-waders to get through the gore); it is about the torture of futility. It brims with sensual enticements, only to see every effort come to disaster. Even Salammbo herself is doomed by the very thing she wants most: she only wishes to become an initiate of Tanit, but her wish leads to her downfall.All that said, I had some fairly significant troubles with the plot, and that started in the very first chapter. The soldiers are rioting through the garden, and Salammbo comes out of her room to scold them (in tongues) for destroying her pet fish. Why, I said to myself, does a father who wants to marry his daughter off well leave her without guards in a place where a bunch of drunken mercenaries can get at her? Once I started reading critically, things went downhill from there. The characters seem to have no control over what happens to them, so they struggle on through an atmosphere of dreamy, cynical futility until the bloody finale. I kept wanting to give someone, preferably Flaubert, a swift kick in the pants."

Held,3/4,5.0,1230422400,Relationships,"This book is primarily about relationships and how sexuality applies but specifically what Giddens terms a ""pure relationship"". This type of relationship exists between two individuals irregardless of gender. Characteristics of this relationship will parallel those of a democracy in that both individuals will have rights and duties but will be equal. Relationships will become a contract between two individuals emphasizing a confluent love rather than one that is dominated by economic and political controlling behaviors resulting in gender inequality associated with relationships within the realm of marriage. Pure relationships will be formed with set parameters according to each individual's needs and desires. Additionally it will not be a relationship ""until death do us part"" but rather one that states ""until we no longer agree to be"". Sex will be one aspect of this relationship that can be negotiated as a rite but not as a duty and will be completely separate to that of the relationship. It will no longer be considered a right of the husband but a means for each individual to acquire pleasure.Hedonism will be widely accepted in the future according to Giddens. In fact he expects Hedonistic Consumerism to replace capitalistic productivity as the driving force behind economics and politics. The consumerism of sex is proof to this phenomenon. During the industrial age one had to work long and hard to be productive while sexual pleasures were considered detrimental to those efforts. The additional disposable time one has earned through an incredible increase in production via the informational age has reversed this view that sexual pleasure is counterproductive. A sexual transformation is at hand.Giddens discusses Freud in detail concerning the phallus and penis envy. He is somewhat critical of Freud but applies these concepts to explain how and why man and woman develop their sexual identity and how this identity explains society. Men develop a masculine identity while women femininity. It is this masculinity that has plagued man for it is a lacking identity. It lacks intimacy and so it desires what it lacks. Women have intimacy but lack independence and autonomy. At some point in modernity women have emerged from their role of mother to join society as an equal of man. This has led to a subconscious effort by man to control women. Man sees this emergence as a threat and as a result responds at times with violence. Rape is the modern context is an act of control or punishment. Rape in pre-modern times usually occurred in the fringes of society such as the frontiers lacking authority, during wars by soldiers, etc. but not as punishment or controlling measure but for the sheer act of sexual pleasure. Rape, according to Giddens, in today's society is committed by loyalists of a day gone by where men ruled the roost. It is their way of being deviant.I think if Giddens is correct we will witness a future in which one will not be viewed as a ""manly man"" or a ""girly girl"" but as an individual without any gender specific roles to portray. This reminds me of Foucault's view on Greek sexuality. The Greeks did not see beauty in the form of a woman or a man but rather saw beauty in a being irregardless of their gender. Bi-sexuality or homosexuality did not exist for they did not recognize the distinction. Giddens celebrates the lifestyles that are emerging in today's world. These lifestyles are in fact not only emerging but are thriving so I would have a hard time disputing his conclusions that sexual emancipation is at hand. One only has to visit any urban city of significant population to witness first-hand the numerous gay bars and nightclubs, swinger's clubs, and BDSM clubs that have opened in recent years. While I gained some insight into what is happening in society concerning sexuality, I am unsure if I should be confused or concerned."
B000PMCF1A,The Catcher in the Rye [Audiobook] [Cd] [Unabridged] (Audio CD),,A30O6N1YGT8FU1,David,2/3,2.0,1332979200,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed in this book. It was one that was on so many recommended reading lists in high school and college, but I never got around to it. It is supposed to be a classic work for an American novel. It has been quoted or referred to in so many other works or movies that I figured it must be riveting. I actually do find the writing to be brilliant, but the story's plot, characters, dialogue and narration are frustrating and boring. There is so much slang that it is extremely, staunchly stuck in its period. I think Salinger could have gone so much further with less slang and vulgarity. You understand right away that the main character is immature and makes no growth throughout the whole story, but the repetitive slang and vulgarity becomes a distraction and diminishes other things that Salinger tries to accomplish. How come I still find it to be brilliant? Because I think Salinger wrote it the way he did intentionally. I think he wants every flaw of Caulfield to stand out in blaring fashion. I think he wants the period to be captured in cement, to have this work stand as a testimony to the deep-seated narcissism in the adolescents of that day, or maybe adolescence in general. I am sure that Salinger has expressed his intentions and the many intellectuals have a better understanding of what he wanted to accomplish, but I find it ironic that the story is held up so enthusiastically as a model for coming of age and adolescent rebellion. If Salinger wants this story to be viewed in such a romantic vision, I think he would have wanted to make the characters and their experiences to be more attractive rather than shallow and pathetic."

B000NREGQ4,Intruder in the Dust,,,,9/10,5.0,1024444800,Still controversial after all these years.,"This novel has a traditional detective story plot and a conventional attitude about race relations (although it was progressive for the South in the late 40s). After that, all bets are off. The style is like a thicket, but that's because Faulkner puts you into the head of a confused boy caught up in events beyond his control. Chick Mallison is white, and his friend Aleck Sander is black (Aleck Sander doesn't know his name isn't two words, because he can't read or write). The paired adult characters of equivalent race are Chick's uncle, Gavin Stevens, a lawyer, who defends Lucas Beauchamp (pronounced ""Beecham""), a black tenant farmer accused of a murder he didn't commit by the people who did it. They know that in a prejudiced society, white people are likely to believe a black man is guilty, so they try to palm it off on him. Lucas is a rather severe character who often doesn't seem to appreciate the help he's getting (part of the plot involves trying to prevent the citizens from pulling him out of jail and lynching him), but he's a marvelous character and something of a father figure to Chick by the end of the book. Reading the book is a bit of a chore at first, but I got through it in high school years ago, and am reading it now for the third time. If you want some help getting into the book, you might try a ""Masterplots"" description of it or a reader's guide to Faulkner (there are several around). You might also look for the 1949 film based on the book, which was filmed in Faulkner's home town of Oxford, Mississippi, with local citizens as extras, and with the great Juano Hernandez playing Lucas."

I was also so surprised by the hypocracy and the involvement of the British government and to some extent certain members within the abolition movement, i.e William Pitt the British prime minister of the day.Tousaint L'Overture certainly grew into the position as Haitian Revolutionary leader and I applaud him and his people of the day for standing up to these barbarians who have the gaul to call Blacks of that day SAVAGES... The crimes which the French British, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish etc inflicted on the African Continent is beyond all comprehension and the atrocities which were described within this book go someway to show who the real savages are, and how the white Supremacist, who are still amongst us today, actually think and have the capacity to behave. The book also went someway to giving me an insight of the French Revolution and the way it was seen by other european countries and I would recommend this book to all black people who need to be aware of how they got to the Carribean or the Americas."

It emphasizes proven techniques to enhance learningand the environment for learning. A strength of this volume isthat the techniques can be utilized in daily life to introducethe conditions most conducive to a meaningful learning experience. American education teaches reading, writing, math,computer schools and the liberal arts. Most schools do not teachlearning utilizing any step-by-step or disciplined approach.The Ostrander work teaches us how people learn and providesmodel exercises to nurture life-long learning skills. Forthis reason alone, the acquisition is well worth the price paid.This book answers the question ""Why doesn't my kid learn?"".For instance,the author introduces the reader to breathing exercises to oxygenate the body so that the mind is relaxed and prepared for concentration. Classical music is introduced as a motivator in facilitating the process of learning and setting theconditions wherein it can occur optimally. The book is well worththe price if the reader actually PRACTICES some of thesetechniques in order to master them. Nothing less than a seriouseffort at following these techniques will be required in orderto appreciate this text. Dr. Lozanov was a pioneer in perfectingtechniques to facilitate healing through relaxation techniquesaimed at obtaining optimal functioning of the mind. I havemodified some of these learning techniques during intensivestudy sessions and they are useful incrementally. Nothing takesthe place of intense motivation aimed at accomplishing importantgoals. These relaxation techniques can facilitate the conditions so that learning can occur; however, the individual needs themotivation to learn. This motivation is accomplished frequentlyby setting goals and visualizing attainment as a condition precedent to performing the work necessary to accomplishelusive goals. Again, this work is valuable incrementallyas a motivator. It is incumbent upon the individual to applythese techniques to translate motivation into action . Goal congruency is critical as a condition precedent to goal attainment. If an individual does not believe in the necessity to attain the goal, then all of the motivating forces will be to little or no avail.This text is useful for readers who keep an open mind .It is necessary to read these techniques dispassionately andhonestly attempt implementation before assessing whether or not this work will be helpful to you.The techniques have validity; however, the reader must struggle through the considerable processes outlined in the text in order to achieve the maximum benefit.This work could be helpful if you have a child with learningissues and you've tried everything to no avail. The techniquesoutlined may be helpful in structuring a learning experienceto compensate for motivational problems, attention-span problemsand a whole host of issues related to early childhood intervention . To be maximally beneficial, you must make anhonest attempt at implementing the techniques outlined in thisbook before making any pre-judgments.People pay professionals thousands of dollars to intervene incomplicated cases involving learning difficulties and motivation.This text provides very valuable advice at little cost. As such,it is well worth the price of admission."

Themes include his memories of his father, the Second World War, and studies of the forgotten characters of the period, and ultimately Drake uses these images to paint a transition between his boyhood view of his father to his eventually becoming similar in many ways to his father.

An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title ""The Man Who Upset The Universe"". It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in the 1940s. While better than the first novel in the series, there are still some weaknesses as a result of age. Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was ""primitive"" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of ""Foundation And Empire"" are:""The General"" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire. The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette ""Dead Hand"" in the April 1945 edition of ""Astounding Science Fiction"".""The Mule"" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event. The Foundation is threatened by a person known only as The Mule. He is mysteriously able to defeat more powerful forces, with inferior forces. This was first published as the novella ""The Mule"" in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in November and December of 1945.The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's ""The Lord Of The Rings"", Smith's ""Lensman"", Heinlein's ""Future History"", and Burroughs' ""Barsoom"" series for the award."

I was expecting something with new ideas about where science and religion meet - something thought-provoking that would push the reader to expand their old, preconceived notions about conscious, etc. What the author does is look back on his career as a robot engineer and explain the unlikely ways that creating robots helped him realize anew the Buddhist principles he grew up with. Interesting, yes, but certainly nothing new, which left me disappointed.The different sections of the book (which you could read independently if you wanted) read to me a lot like the sermons I grew up with at Catholic mass as a kid, when the priest talked about all the old Biblical stories, but related them to modern life. In a nutshell, this book does the exact same thing, only with Buddhism.Granted, I only ended up skimming through it because it lost my interest, so it's possible there's a chapter here or there that offers something more than a modern Buddhist sermon, but it wouldn't be enough to salvage the book as a whole for me."

While the sex scenes in the novel are intense, this book is much more than erotica. My first shock was when my husband, who never reads anything unless it is mandatory for work, walked through the front door with both this book and Zane's other book The Sex Chronicles. Now, that's erotica. :-)As a married woman who has endured ups and downs in my relationship of over twenty years, Addicted opened my eyes to a lot of things and made me question my own motives for certain behavior. It is a crisp, honest look at what can happen to a marriage when the lines of communication break down. It also shows what miracles can occur when the lines are reopened, which is what happened after my husband and I both read the book. For the first time in our twenty-three year marriage, my husband actually asked me about my desires. Thanks to Zane and Addicted, things have never been better.I loved the part of the book that explored their childhoods because it provided tremendous insight into the reasoning behind the madness. As children, girls are taught that certain things are taboo and that often trickles over into adulthood, as it did with the main character of this novel. Addicted is an excellent read and Zane is an excellent author."

B0009KKVZU,Moll Flanders,,A12A08OL0TZY0W,Luc REYNAERT,5/7,5.0,1125619200,"Give me not Poverty, lest I steal","This human portrait of a woman is also an excellent sketch of the living conditions and the social stratification in England in the 18th century: 'the Age is so wicked and the Sex so Debauch'd'.It shows the immense chasm between a small class of wealthy people and the rest (Swift: 'a thousand to one'). The latter were struggling for sheer survival and praying 'Give me not Poverty, lest I steal' ... to be hanged: 'If I swing by the String, I shall hear the Bell ring, and then there's an End of poor Jenny.'But both classes intermingled.As E.J. Burford quotes in his masterful book 'The Synfulle Citie':Those who were riche were hangid by the PursseThose who were poore were hangid by the NeckeMoll Flanders: 'the passive Jade thinks of no Pleasure but the Money; and when he is as it were drunk in the Extasies of his wicked Pleasure, her Hands are in his Pockets.'The poor's religion was fatalism. Moll Flanders is all the time reproaching herself her Course of Life, 'a horrid Complication of Wickedness, Whoredom, Adultery, Incest, Lying, Theft...', but in the face of death at the gallows: 'I had now neither Remorse or Repentance ... no Thought of Heaven or Hell ... I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy.'Defoe's work is eminently modern with his psychological insight: 'What a Felicity is it to Mankind that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another, and 'Modest men are better Hypocrites';or, the ravage of alcoholism: 'the Drunk are the Men of whom Solomon says , they go like an Ox to the slaughter, till a Dart strikes through their Liver';and his feminism: 'the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon Men', and 'Money only made a Woman agreeable'.Defoe's appeal to the reader 'every Branch of my Story may be useful to honest People', seems to be a smokescreen in order to circumvent censorship, because ultimately Moll Flanders prospers. This book is a perfect illustration of Bernard Mandeville's 'Triumph of Private Vices' in his 'Fable of the Bees'.Although some developments in this story are rather improbable, this superbly ironic and lively text constitutes an immortal portrait of the 'horrid Complication' to be a woman, here personified in Moll Flanders.Not to be missed."

B000I1DFMG,Icy Sparks,,A2HR0DJG4WMR8R,"Maurice Williams ""mauricewms""",8/10,4.0,986947200,It Crept Up On Me . . .,"This started off as just an o.k. read. I thought the story line, a coming of age account of a girl with Tourette syndrome, offered great potential. I was excited to start the novel, but I couldn't seem to get immersed in the story. The writing is quite clear, with excellent dialogue and memorable characters. However, I didn't feel that I was learning anything more about the specifics of Tourettes. Icy's trials seemed no greater than anyone who doesn't fit within the confines of what our culture deems normal. Then came the light bulb moment. Perhaps that's exactly the point Rubio is trying to make, that it matters not what our differences are, we deserve to be accepted for them, included with them. Rubio further demonstrates that with the love of family, friends and God - from whatever pulpit you choose to worship him - it is possible to embrace one's own differences and thrive with them.

B000K3DDFQ,Isaiah Effect,,,,24/33,2.0,1021939200,Hampered by sloppy scholarship,"It's an intriguing concept--that prayer might allow one to choose one's reality. It's not wholly a bogus idea--Evan Harris Walker explores similar territory in his &quot;Physics of Consciousness&quot;, in which he says that it may be possible that one's will, when properly marshalled, can have effects on quantum events, and, perhaps, events in the macroworld.Braden is not as careful as Walker; he interprets suggestive research as proving his thesis, even when it does not. Indeed, he breathlessly reports as if modern science was in general agreement with him, which it is decidedly not. I would wager that most scientists would have little sympathy for these ideas.Braden's idea that prophecies such as that of Isaiah in the Old Testament reveal different possible quantum futures is an interesting idea--one that Braden doesn't really develop fully.Braden also suggests that ancient the Essenes somehow had intuited all of this. To support this thesis, he quotes heavily from Edmond Szekely's &quot;Essene Gospel of Peace&quot;, and infers that it is one of the Dead Sea Scrolls. This is quite false.In truth, the actual Dead Sea Scrolls have a completely different focus and concern--they are reveal a profoundly apocalyptic mindset, quite unlike Szekely's &quot;gospel&quot;, which most scholars believe the French-Hungarian Szekely wrote himself.It is unfortunate--Braden seems sincere, and the basic idea of the book is an interesting one--but his scholarship is so sloppy that it is hard to take him seriously."

B000O3Q0SY,Waiting,,A1DT2G32EIXUWV,April Koh,4/4,4.0,963100800,A deceptive love story,"&quot;Waiting&quot; to me , is on a whole a deceptive romantic love story. Initally, through reading the first two parts of the novel, the reader will get an idea that she is reading an enduring love story where love can conquer all odds.However, at the end of the novel, I get the idea that no love exist at all between Lin Kong and Manna. They are just together because they have been Wating for each other for so long. &quot;Waiting&quot; thus gives the reader a depressing view of love in the end. To me, no true love exists in the book and the last line of the novel clearly illustrates the idea that Lin is just waiting for Manna to die so that he can return to Shuyu.The protagonist is selfish and crowdly to the very end and he is a pathetic character who does not know what he wants.This book is a fine literary read that offers many ideas about human emotions . It is a must read for anyone who wants to think about the issues of love and the selfish nature of man. I truly enjoyed this book although it is , on the whole, a really bleak portrayal of human nature and love.Ha Jin's simple and direct prose also assists in bringing his ideas more closely to the reader ."

In his characteristic style of narration, with exceptional command over facts and the English language, he is once again at his best in this book - a collection of his recent articles on the new economy and the future of Society. Starting from the invention of the steam engine ( James Watt - 1776), the steam boat ( 1807) to the first railroad ( 1829), the first article &quot;Beyond the information Revolution&quot; describes similarities between the Industrial revolution and the Information Revolution. Moore's law is applicable to the computer's processing power today. A similar phenomenon happened to the cost and productivity of textiles in the Industrial age. Since then, the global economies have transformed completely and today we have a knowledge-based society. The decline of Agriculture during the Industrial age is similar to the decline of Manufacturing in the last four decades.What lies ahead, in terms of demographic, social, economic and business scenarios, during the next three decades makes fascinating reading.

006063040X,The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? The Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus,18.18,A2TCL3XLU57QC,"Frank Mclaughlin ""frank mclaughlin""",21/30,5.0,1068422400,Exciting and interesting search for truth,"This is a tremendous work for those interested in understanding exactly what it is that Jesus might have said and taught as closely as can be determined from the ancient writings of his followers. This includes the four Gospels translated directly from the ancient Greek and the new Gospel of Thomas, which was discovered in Egypt in 1945 as part of the Nag Hammadi texts. The Gospel of Thomas, from a copy of an early third century manuscript, ""has survived in its full form only in Coptic, although its original language was Greek.""The translations are by a panel of Christian scholars, many from prestigious religious institutions such as the University of Notre Dame, DePaul University (J. Dominic Crossan), Xavier University, Eden Theological Seminary and Texas Christian University. It is ""free of ecclesiastical and religious control, unlike other major translations into English.""Jesus spoke and probably taught in Aramaic, his native language, and possible in Hebrew. His followers translated what he spoke into Greek and Hebrew, and passed the his teaching and the stories of his life down to another generation who copied those words into sayings and stories in Greek. These ""gospels"" were translated into Latin as the western word lost its facility with Greek. Those Latin words were then translated into early 17th century English. Today, when we read what people who didn't know Jesus firsthand had to say about his teaching, we are reading a translation of translations, and when you consider the ambiguity that normally arises in matters of religion and metaphysics, it is no wonder we have hundreds of branches of Christianity all claiming something different.Each Gospel is translated in modern English directly from its source language and color-coded ""red,"" ""pink,"" ""gray,"" and ""black"" to reflected whether is very likely (red) or very unlikely (black) that Jesus might have spoken the words attributed to him. This is based on comparing the Gospels to each other and to other ancient written sources about Jesus, the language used, and independent historical sources.The controversial finding here is the claim that 82 percent of the words attributed to Jesus in the Gospels probably were not spoken by him, including almost the entire Gospel of John. This is no surprise to me considering the parallels between the miracles attributed to Jesus and the corresponding miracles attributed to the greek gods Jesus was originally competing against. Or when I think about the claim that the first miracle by Jesus was making more wine for people at a wedding who had already drunk the existing supply. When you look at the saints, rishis and avatars of other religious traditions, the admonition is to purify and cleanse oneself so as to be able to experience God within. Indeed, the early Desert Fathers of the Christian church practiced austerities and fasted to become pure. Hard to imagine Jesus creating wine so people could intoxicate themselves at a party.This accords well with Elaine Pagels contention in her new book ""Beyond Belief"" that the Gospel of John, the last to appear around 100 c.e., was written by someone who was attempting to refute Thomas, and its message that union with Jesus or God could be directly experienced in much the same way it has been written about in the Vedic tradition (India) by Christian mystics.What is valuable is that after each passage is translated, what follows is a scholarly discussion on how that translation was arrived at, background information, what exactly the words could have meant in another context or translation and how those words compare to the writings of the other gospels.Worth the price of the book is the first 38 pages that discuss the probable history of the Gospels, the saying of ""Q"" as a precursor to Matthew and Luke, the differences between John, Thomas and the other Gospels and how the scholars went about their research. Throughout the book side-pages explain terminology, Paul of Tarsus, the meaning of ""tense"" (the use of past tense or present tense in the writings), the ""I am sayings in the Gospel of John. Also provided are direct comparisons of the gospel language from similar passages.The audience for this book is not those who wish to rely on faith in understanding Jesus. The findings are controversial, but book provides a great wealth of new information on the gospels of Jesus. It will give you tools to begin to evaluate for yourself as you read the passages of the gospels what Jesus might and might not have said."

B000GROP62,Nineteen Eighty-four,,AJ98YA4Y333BK,"CJA ""CJA""",2/2,5.0,1275609600,The Great Novel of the 20th Century,"In terms of exploring the human condition in the modern era, this is the great novel of the twentieth century. I first read this book in 1968, when 1984 seemed far in the future. Now it's 26 years in the past. The totalitarian regime of the Soviet Union which so much concerned Orwell is also long gone. But the novel lives on for good reason.Orwell's book will be read for centuries -- when the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century are as distant in the past as the 30 Years War is from us -- because Orwell is concerned about the nature of reality and the nature of power. Reality, after all, is a construct. We must strive to superimpose some narrative on the events and data swirling around us. This requires the use of language and the use of a context. Therefore, if one controls language and one controls the historical record that gives everything a context, one can control and manipulate everyone's reality. One can, in short, achieve absolute power.In the future dystopia imagined by Orwell the state controls language and constantly rewrites the past. Words are systmatically eliminated from the English language so that there are no longer any shades of gray. Absolute control over information is achieved so that however ridiculous the latest message from the party, it must be believed -- and if it is not believed, one begins to question one's own sanity.Much of debate surrounding this book centers around whether the precise dystopia predicted by Orwell will ever actually occur, thereby missing the point. Given the information revolution, the shrinking of the world, and the fall of the Soviet Union, we are less concerned today about the threat of a totalitarian regime than we are by resource limitations. The dystopia we now imagine concerns a constant state of war over shrinking resources complicated by the ability of small fringe groups to use terror as an effective weapon against highly centralized and complex modern structures.But Orwell's vision is more fundamental. Given the profound ability to manipulate and control the individual, what is to prevent humanity from ultimately degenerating over the next millenia into systems resembling the ant heap? For Orwell, the individual's duty is to be constantly vigilant about manipulations of language, ideas, and history that occur in every society so that we don't take any steps toward the world of the ant heap.This is an absolutely brilliant book, written with great passion in 1948 by a dying man concerned about the human condition. It is one of the few books that everyone must read."

0582528259,Jane Eyre (Simple English),,A2S2PDXJMO49VU,Jiahao,0/0,4.0,1329177600,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.""Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.""Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain."
0880885661,Walden,,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,"Rama Rao ""Rama""",0/0,5.0,1301356800,Henry David Thoreau and Hindu scriptures,"Reading through the pages of this book makes you wonder if the author was a hermit and a heretic or a social reformer, or a mystical philosopher. ""On Walden Pond"" sounds similar to the classic movie ""On Golden Pond,"" starring Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn. There are some similarities; in both stories the lead characters go and live near a secluded lake (pond) to spend their lives, but Thoreau goes a step forward to find himself and his soul when he can't accept the status quo of life. His journey is to find the truth that is beyond the apparent reality: A search for transcendental truth of Bhagavadgita and Upanishads. His search for the nature of soul is found in the tranquility of Walden Pond when he states that, ""In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modem world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! There I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges. With favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of Atlantis and the Hesperides, makes the periplus of Hanno, and, floating by Temate and Tidore and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, melts in the tropic gales of the Indian seas, and is landed in ports of which Alexander (the Great) only heard the names."" Through these passages he compares himself to the great Vedic sages and rishis who meditated deep in the woods for prolonged period of time in total tranquility to realize spiritual awakening. Thoreau was a prophet who had the same identity crisis as his better known contemporaries like; Emerson, Whitman, Channing, Hawthorne, Melville, and Dickinson. But among these men, Thoreau was forerunner as practitioner. He insisted that knowledge without experience or action is a false knowledge.Thoreau's passion to seek inner meaning of life is illustrated by his disappointment in the traditional Christian culture; ""We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of agriculture. We have built for this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten."" In another paragraph he observes; ""For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify God and enjoy him forever."" In another section of the book, Thoreau writes, ""We perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit every where, which still is built on purely illusory foundations."" He continues in the later part of the paragraph, ""I have read in a Hindoo book, that there was a king's son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his father's ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,"" continues the Hindoo philosopher, ""from the circumstances, in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows itself to be Brahme. I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things.""Thoreau was also keenly interested in the work Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution. In many ways he resembled Darwin in his patient observations and Benjamin Franklin in his inventive practicality. Unlike most transcendentalists, he could do things, tend to garden and make home repairs for Emerson, or actualize the real carpentry Branson Alcott's fanciful vision of a summer house.Thoreau expresses strong belief in social reforms when he refuses to pay taxes in protest against practice of slavery in Southern States. He championed abolitionist John Brown whom he met briefly in Concord, Massachusetts. In one paragraph he laments; ""I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous,.."" ""There are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south. It is hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to have a northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave driver of your soul.""1.Civil Disobedience2.The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson & Henry David Thoreau3.Henry David Thoreau : A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers / Walden; Or, Life in the Woods / The Maine Woods / Cape Cod (Library of America)"

However, this book should not be attempted by a weekend reader. While the series is good, the first book moves slowly, and I feel that unless you read books quick you will get disenhartened and bored before long - but if you do make it to the end, one of the best endings of all books awaits. Its other strengths are a believable fantasy world - a human world, with almost no magic, monsters or other races, meaning that the world is understandable and easier to emerse oneself in - like Eddings, without gods. Note that the word is almost - minute amounts of magic, monsters and elf-equivalents appear in mostly supporting roles."

The book is very good at explaining the process, and explaining each of the sections. It has plenty of review problems, which are similar in difficulty to the ones on the test itself. I read through the entire book (which is much smaller than my official SAT review book, I might add) and took one practice exam.On the day of the exam, I felt confident in my abilities, and wasn't shocked by the exam; in fact, I found it much easier than the SAT. My scores reflected that; even though I only have a 1410 on the SAT, my ACT score (first time!) was a 34, including a perfect score of 36 for the science section and a near-perfect 35 on the critical reading section.

B000MTCULG,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,"fra7299 ""fra7299""",2/3,3.0,1214784000,"Love Twain's writing, but not so much in this one","Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are ""classic"" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: ""Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel..."" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too ""preachy"" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."

I felt the book was extremely slanted and left little to be desired in terms of suspense or plot twist. What's more - there HAS to be a way for Ann Rule to drive her point home without repeating key plot elements verbatim over and over again. Often times, I would put the book down, only to find when I picked it up again, I felt I had accidentally lost my place and gone backwards. Seriously, paragraphs and paragraphs of unnecessary repitition litter this otherwise gripping story of a mother driven to horrific revenge to ""punish"" her husband for his actions. Yes, this is true crime and consistent details among third parties are key - but hearing the same phrases about the father, Mike, again and again certainly supported the fact that Deborah had turned the kids against him - but really, they were mentioned no less than four times throughout (often by the same people, in different conversations) - just to make sure we ""got it."" Paraphrasing the trial portion also would have been nice. I could have (and did) skip ahead just to get to the climax - after all the story is written in such an anti-Deborah fashion that my mind was made up after the first chapter. After that, there's Mike's letter and an Epilogue which adds no insight or clues that weren't already brought to bear earlier in the book.Overall the story drags at times and could've been more concisely written. But Ann Rule is the master - so I'm not sure who could've told it better... I was hooked on her style after reading The Stranger Beside Me many years ago. This won't be the last book of hers I read."

While it certainly has more ""adult"" content than much of Judy Blume's oeuvre, it is hardly trashy. The book recounts the tale of the friendship between two girls: wealthy, wild, and beautiful Caitlin Somers, and her ""summer sister,"" Victoria ""Vix"" Leonard, a smart, quiet girl from a working class family. Vix is enraptured by Caitlin's life and family, and the two girls grow up together during summers on Martha's Vineyard, forging a relationship that neither time nor seeming betrayal can end.I read this novel for the first time as a rather impressionable fourteen year old, so perhaps much of my adoration for this book is nostalgia. I believe there's more to it than that, however. Blume's characters are real, believable and relatable. Blume sets the saga of Caitlin and Vix's friendship alongside an entrancing picaresque of island life. Yes, there is sex in the novel, but it is deftly woven into the larger story of trying to find yourself while growing up, laced with all the uncertainties of being seventeen and in love for the first time. What is more, Blume doesn't give the reader an easy ending, choosing rather to leave things frustratingly ambiguous in a way that aptly mirrors the tenure of the girls' friendship.It may not be ""high"" literature, but it's definitely worth a read, especially for summertime."
0226012581,Sonoran Desert Spring,,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,Stephen A. Haines,7/8,5.0,1076371200,Evolutionary logic,"The common view of deserts as &quot;barren&quot; places empty of life is firmly laid to rest by this excellent collection of essays. Alcock's relation demonstrates the wide variety and diversity of lifeforms found in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. Plants, insects, birds and other animal life abound if you take the trouble to find them. The author is an expert at observing all this life. Better, he's adept at showing you how to follow in his footsteps to see what he sees.&quot;Footsteps&quot; is the significant term in this book. Not ATVs, aircraft, nor other vehicular means, but walking quietly is the method to employ in behold ing the desert. Alcock provides examples of his techniques in researching various aspects of life. Surprising wasps in their rituals requires finesse and timing. Seemingly, he moves directly from office to landscape - one of his marking tools being a bottle of Liquid Paper. With this &quot;paint&quot; he can identify individual insects - male wasps and butterflies seeking mates. This technique lapses with rattlesnakes and coyotes, however.More easily identified subjects are the palo verde trees and giant saguaro cactuses. His palo verde trees are numbered [in his memory], but the saguaros are often elusive. Not because these ancient, giant cacti are mobile, but because his urban neighbours see fit to use them for target practice. Many of his jaunts confront him with spent shells, pock-marked rocks and shattered giant cactus plants. Desert soil pockets, often the home of slumbering spade-foot toads are riven with vehicle tracks. Their passage disturbs the dormant toads who believe the noise presages water-delivering thunderstorms. Awakening, they emerge in the belief the water is signalling the time for courtship and reproduction. The disappointment is greater than simply mating deferred. It may mean the toad has expended its resources. It will dry out and expire.In describing how the details of desert life is seen today, Alcock muses on the roots of life's processes. Why do the Tarantula Wasp and the Great Purple Hairstreak butterfly [which displays nothing visible that's purple] evolve parallel mating rituals? How can some species successfully deal with the spines of the cholla cactus when a human stuck with the spines must endure a full day's pain? Why do some bees fly in solitude while others are flock in swarms? Alcock examines these and similar questions with sound evolutionary logic. He stresses that simple or apparent solutions often require re-examination. Horned lizards only take a few ants from a nest entrance. Are they &quot;prudent predators&quot; saving prey for later exploitation? Alcock reflects on possibilities to arrive at a solution Darwin would have admired. As do we.

Clavell has taken the wonderful foundation of Tai-Pan and Shogun and added new levels of depth and complexity.At the beginning of the novel, young Ian Dunross assumes the mantle of Tai-Pan of the Noble House of Struan during a dark and stormy night and a dark and stormy period for the Noble House. The company's holdings are stretched to the limit, and that very night it loses a shipment of valuable contraband at sea. Dunross, heir to the title of Tai-Pan, or supreme leader, is also the kindred spirit to the company's founder, Dirk Struan, the legendary pirate, smuggler, and founder of the Noble House and Hong Kong. Dunross has also inherited the enduring hatred of the family's historical enemies, the Brocks, now personified in Quillan Gornt, head of the Second House. Gornt, a worthy adversary, has his own designs to topple Struan's and take over as the Noble House.But so does everybody else in the novel, it seems, unless the characters are interested in international espionage involving the Soviet Union, Communist China, the United States, or good old England. Triple agents, royalty, thieves, kidnappers, murderers, gangsters, and businessmen rub shoulders in this tempest in the teapot of Hong Kong.The key variables in this play are two Americans on a business trip, who hold the key to finiancial success in Hong Kong. Linc Bartlett is CEO, and his right-hand man is the beautiful woman, K.C. Tcholok. The Americans' ignorance of Hong Kong customs reflects the reader's, and injects a considerable amount of humor into the novel.But, as with Clavell's first novel (Tai-Pan), the center of attention remains the tai-pan. Ian Dunross is the personification of what is good in the British Empire, even though he is as ruthless as they come. He guides the Noble House through a minefield without a map, using his business acumen, guts, and joss to see him through. A climactic ending to an epic story of love, business, and war is immensely satisfying, and leaves you begging for more (just like Tai-Pan, Shogun, and King Rat did before). A must-read!"

Not only does it spend too much time with detail, it seems to drag on FOREVER. A complete waste of time. Smith spends so much time on character development yet none of the characters are interesting or intelligent. And it never ends! If you are suicidal, do not read this book--it's too depressing. This is the first book I have actually hated. When I read it I daydreamed at least 50 times a page. I though I would never finish. This book is for sensative, emotional girls who cried during Titanic. Boys who like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction will want to burn this book after reading ten pages. Trust me. A lot of people like it because they can &quot;relate&quot; to it. But that's not what literature is about. Literature is about telling an interesting story in a manner that provokes thought, not about spending three-quarters of the book getting people &quot;attached&quot; to the characters and then at the end put them through a tragedy that makes sensative people cry and delute themselves into thinking the book was &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. Take my word for it, this book is wordy and poorly though out."
0060551526,The Inner Reaches of Outer Space: Metaphor As Myth and As Religion,,A37B3O457INKEA,Peter Kenney,40/40,5.0,1054598400,Waiting For A New Mythology,"In THE INNER REACHES OF OUTER SPACE Joseph Campbell repeats some of the familiar observations of his earlier works in which he shows how certain mythic motifs can be found buried in all of the world's religious traditions. The similarities may not be easily recognized because the same motifs are usually understood and developed in different ways because of cultural differences. These repetitive motifs are called elementary ideas and in the local forms where they appear in various religions they are known as ethnic or folk ideas. As examples of elementary ideas Campbell offers the concepts of the Promised Land and the Virgin Birth. In writing about the similarities of symbols found in ancient civilizations, Campbell mentions discoveries among such diverse societies as those that existed in the Indus Valley, Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and Ireland.Because of the great advances in learning which have become accelerated and dramatized by space exploration, Campbell points out that our old gods are either already dead or dying. The big question now is what new mythology will emerge from a modern understanding of a unified planet amidst a vast universe.The creation of any new mythology will certainly depend in part on the contributions of art because artists will be the ones who will produce the images of the future. Those images will come from our knowledge of a constantly changing and expanding universe. Campbell writes about the connection between art and mythology with conviction, no doubt due to the long-standing influence of his wife, Jean Erdman, a well-known dancer and choreographer.The most remarkable feature evident in THE INNER REACHES OF OUTER SPACE is the breadth and depth of the author's knowledge and understanding of mythology. Joseph Campbell led an enviable life driven by a singular passion and his writings are the best reflection of that life."

On their honeymoon Valeria finds out that Eustace married her under an assumed name...and that he was never acquitted of the murder of his first wife. Eustace immediately leaves her to protect her from his shame and disgrace.Her happiness crumbles, but she steadfastly believes in his innocence. She makes it her life's goal to prove he did NOT murder his wife, to clear his name. But if he didn't murder his wife, then who did? Women were not supposed to investigate these matters in those days, so she faces lots of opposition, even from her friends.Valeria is a wonderful, strong female lead and the reader can't help but cheer her on in her battles. Along her journey she meets some eccentric characters that brighten the novel, such as Major Fitz-David - a 'major' flirt, and the brilliant, eccentric disabled man named Dexter.I loved this book. After Part One I could NOT put it down...I needed to find out how it ended.It's hard to say anything bad about this book. The only negative to me was reading the views of society at the time.

Ms. Huffington gives numerous examples of fearless women, some well-known and others not, who have faced their fears and attempted to understand them. Fear takes two forms - worry over repeating past failures and / or worry over unknown failures yet to come in the future. Ms. Huffington gives examples of both and shows the personal and professional success that women can realize when they acknowledge their strengths, assess their limitations realistically, and move into - rather than away from - the life situations that they fear. She brings up an important point about fear of success. We are all too familiar with fear of failure, worry over not reaching our goals; however, fear of success is just as debilitating. It causes women to fear the life changes that inevitably result from being successful. They include a change in place of residence to take a new job, a change in schedule with less time for kids and husband, or a change in role or status within the family dynamics. But fear of success is also worry over being able to consistently perform at the new job, fear of not being able to maintain, and the loss of security from the previous job. This also applies to relationships which take a lot of sustained work - fear of success brings worry over the stamina, time, and energy needed to make a relationship successful. It can cause women to think, ""do I really want to do this?"", ""was being single so bad?"" Stories such as Ms. Huffington offers are always helpful in giving our fears a name and in showing us that fear is universal. Success, however, and how each woman chooses to go about attaining it, is individual and personal. Go for it!Ellen M.

It's an autobiographical fiction: true on both counts. I believe Roth is a genius. I've read or seen the films of just about everything he's written. He makes me feel warm by addressing ideas that really matter and by bringing family stories alive. Little Philip is a noble, caring child, whose values stem from parents with commendable values. They take risks ; never flinch from helping others in perilous or pitiable situations. Of course, we also hear the other side of Philip's thinking; sometimes he is disgusted by the people he knows he must help, but this doesn't stop him. I loved the way he puzzled over enigmas: people and situations he didn't - couldn't - possibly understand. And this book shows us how wild his imagination was right from the start. He was born to be a writer; to tell stories. His sentences: marvels of construction. I love following them to their exhilerating conclusions. Bravo, Mr. Roth. You did it again!

Without being mean-spirited or condescending, author James Robert Parish discusses a series of such films - from the ""Cleopatra"" debacle that almost ruined 20th Century-Fox to recent misfires such as ""Town & Country"" - in a manner that helps us understand the illogic that rules Hollywood studios, and by extension, big business everywhere. And still, they prosper. So much for the efficiency of the corporate mentality. I read many film books, but Parish's are invariably among my favorites. Highly recommended. (Here's hoping that when Fiascos II: The Disastrous Sequel comes along, that it'll include films made before 1960. Old Hollywood has a lot of horror stories to tell, too. And perhaps a couple of overseas fiascos, too? This mix of arrogance and ineptitude is hardly just a Hollywood phenomenon.)"

B000NUMU3W,The Eustace Diamonds,,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,"H. Schneider ""Hermit""",1/1,5.0,1281484800,A peasant may marry whom he pleases,"Anthony Trollope's variation on Wilkie Collins' Moonstone story was a public success, but the critics ignored it. It was too much of the same old, the man had been around for so long, and he stuck to his guns, essentially, with his leisurely style of relaxed communications with the reader, with his technique of suspense by concealed consequences, though in a way, this novel is unusually fast paced. It was number 3 in the Palliser sextet and is good fun.We have two heroines.a) Lizzie Greystock becomes Lady Eustace and soon a rich widow. She is a beauty and smart and greedy and deeply ignorant (`she was quick as a lizard in turning hither and thither, but knew almost nothing'), who is not clear about the legal implications of her inheritance and has no friends with the practical knowledge to advise her against the legal forces that her in-laws activate against her. This is a typical Trollope woman: we understand her problems, but are not expected to like her.b) Lucy Morris is a poor governess with a personality, with charming manners, and with a rational mind. She loves a man of whom she knows that he needs a rich wife, hence she expects little. Trollope talks down to her with a kind of patronizing respect. She is a typical Trollope woman: we like her but can't quite see the way out for her.The man is Frank Greystock, Lizzie's cousin, a young barrister and Member of Parliament, who could well use his cousin's money. He is a bit of an opportunist, but not an entirely bad character at all. Unfortunately he is a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character. His Jekyll version does all the right things and behaves decently, but when Hyde comes over him, all rules are off.Frank represents the conservatives in the house, though he has no convictions to speak of. A barrister doesn't need any.(This gives Trollope a reason to muse about conservatives in general, and his comments are quite amusing. He had run for parliament himself, as a `radical', meaning a candidate for the Liberal Party, and had lost badly. He calls himself a `conservative liberal'.)There is another suitor for Lizzie, Lord Fawn, who can give her a peerage, but he is miserably poor for an aristocrat and politician, and he needs her money as badly as Greystock. His family hates Lizzie as much as her first set of in-laws. The woman is marvelously good ad attracting dislike.The main theme of the plot is a legal entanglement and dispute: who is the rightful owner of the diamonds that the Eustace family considers part of the family property and that Lizzie considers a gift from her husband. That may look like an easy issue, but if you think so, you must have forgotten all that you know of the English legal system of the time from Dickens and others. (Not sure if it has changed since.)Lizzie is stubborn and will not give up the diamonds, which endangers her engagement with Lord Fawn and her cousin's friendship with the Fawn family. The issue becomes a favorite subject of rumors and false claims in London society.Lord Fawn is neither rich nor important, but he is an Under-Secretary in the Whig government, serving the India Secretary, while Lizzie's champion is a rising star of the Tories. Hence there is a political dimension to the dispute.And don't forget the India angle! Like the Moonstone in Collins, the Eustace diamonds have their exotic originals as well! And of course the underworld learns about the stones and has special interests devoted to them.What an entertaining mess!"

While there are a number of interesting characters and unique ideas, there are also many times where it reads like a bad action movie, where the main character does some needlessly masculine posturing in order to... to do what, I don't know. Most of the times he does it, it's really kinda just irritating and detracts from the flow of the story itself. There's also this big deal about this drug or something that maybe kills you slowly after you take it no matter what, and is more or less like a non-sexually transmitted AIDs. Having more than had my fill of reading gay stories that deal with some sort of killer disease it was something of a continual annoyance to keep reading about how this futuristic society with laser guns and empaths couldn't seem to find a cure for some reason or something. I don't mean to make my review sound negative or anything though, it's just that all the minor annoyances were pretty much equal to all the minor pleasures of the book, so it more or less just broke even.All that aside though it's passibly entertaining if you like the Space Exploration genre. If you dig games like Starcraft, the Dune books, or Star Trek, you'll probably be entertained by this for a while. I myself didn't find it particularly terrible, and I don't regret reading the book. It's just that afterwards, I just didn't feel the need to read either the first one in the series (if there is one, which I think there is) or the next one (if there is a next one).

B000H01HX2,Cat's Cradle,,A5TWTUNP05CPJ,Scrapple8,0/0,5.0,1359763200,"The cat's in the Cradle, Silver Spoon...","In 1963, when the fear of nuclear annihilation was foremost on the minds of Americans, Kurt Vonnegut wrote Cat's Cradle. The novel was written just after Khrushchev and Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis. Cat's Cradle is loosely based on a father of the Manhattan Project, the scientific thrust of America to design and build the nuclear bomb that was eventually denoted on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The narrator set out to write a book called ""The Day the World Died"" by interviewing the surviving members of the scientist's family, but a push into Bokononism changed his frame of reference.Many consider Robert Oppenheimer the father of the nuclear bomb, but here, the man is Felix Hoenikker, a scientist at the General Forge and Foundry Company in Ilion, NY. There are elements of Oppenheimer in the fictional scientist of Vonnegut's novel, but Vonnegut based Hoenikker on a scientist he knew from his job at General Electric. Hoenikker is survived by his three children: Newt, a dwarf, Angela, a thin, horse-faced woman, and Frank, a drifter. The narrator also learns that an even more dangerous invention of Felix Hoeniker may exist, a substance called Ice-Nine.The 'vin-dit,' a sudden shove in the direction of Bokononism, occurred in the shop of a maker of tombstones in Ilion. The town of Ilion in Cat's Cradle is based on Schenectady, NY - one of the tri-cities in Eastern New York State, along with Troy and Albany. The proprietor of the shop was Avram Breed, quite a coincidence because the narrator just finished visiting the foundry operated by Asa Breed. Both Breeds were brothers. Even more coincidental was the story of a gaudy tombstone ordered by an immigrant generations ago. The name of that immigrant is a sensational detail in the story.Foma is the cornerstone of Bokononism, something that the author believes is true of religion, politics, and maybe even science. Bokononism is also forbidden in the country of San Lorenzo, yet it is also the national religion of the country. San Lorenzo is a fictional country in the Caribbean Sea which serves as the location for the second half of the novel. The national leaders of San Lorenzo secretly practice Bokononism, as do most of the people.There was probably a time, before I was born, when people used these made-up words from Cat's Cradle in everyday conversation. Using them today will get you a lot of blank looks, but the philosophy behind the novel is timeless. Cat's Cradle is vintage Vonnegut, capturing the concern of the student protest movement about the direction of post-war society, with a slight twist of dark humor that makes the novel a Vonnegut classic. Along with Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle is easily one of the decade's most influential books, and one of the century's most thought-provoking novels."
B00009ANY9,Cane River,,,,7/17,2.0,1009411200,Caveat lector,"This is not really history and it's not really a novel. The story isn't really interesting enough to be a novel--you read it avidly at first because you think it's a &quot;real story&quot;--but as the author notes at the beginning, she changed dates, names, circumstances supposedly to improve the story (well, she should have changed a lot more then). But then when you begin looking at the &quot;evidence&quot; printed as illustrations you notice that she (or her genealogist?) made mistakes in transcribing the French, includes names in her transcriptions that aren't really in the sources, and she repeatedly notes errors in her primary sources as well. To a real historian this smacks of someone changing her sources to make her imagined story fit. Real historians accept that they can't always trace the neat trail they would like to--Tademy just changes things to make them fit her story and thinks, I guess that the reader won't even notice. She doesn't even provide real reproductions of the newspaper articles she shows &quot;photographs&quot; of--they're just transcripts typed in a modern font. Anyway, I found myself wondering how much of the story was at all findable in primary documents. When I decided she more or less made this up out of whole cloth and her ideas of how her descendants could be, I got really bored with the sort of nonexistent plot. If you want real literature about the slave experience, read Alice Walker. If you want real history, read Ball's book about the slaves in his family. This apparent hybrid is neither, and as such it is a waste of time. If I were Jonathan Franzen I would definitely not want anything I wrote on the same list with this work of dubious value."

0310338301,Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference,,A2VVRWYNBQ2Z9,Richard Aubrey,5/7,3.0,1174348800,Mind stretcher,"This is an amazing book, using the term ""amazing"" without necessarily meaning anything either positive or negative.Crabb promotes a Biblical idea of the difference in gender roles. He supports his points by scriptural reference, by referring to his counseling, and to common sense.If you don't like his goal, if you have the modern view of such things, this book will make your teeth hurt. Not only will his goals set your hair on fire, he is, above all, plausible. He is not slick-plausible. He is a good writer and organizer of his material.For those who disagree, even vehemently disagree, with his views, it would be an educational experience to deal with his book using logic and reason. Ripping it to shreds and jumping up and down on the scraps while screaming obscenities--which passes for scholarship in some fields--is not what I'm talking about. Deal with this book, whatever your position, with reason, logic, and fact, and you will know more about, among other things, what you think and why you think it.I was particularly struck by his extensive investigation into how a wife's regard for her husband can build him up or ruin him. The same is mentioned in passing by other writers in the fiels, but Crabb goes into some detail.Crabb spends the bulk of his time exploring marital issues. It appears to me that, if men and women are to take gender-separate roles, the manifestations of such differences would be in the workplace, or in other groups. Crabb doesn't get into this. I expect that telling a woman to be a helpmate and to accept husband's decisions with a joyful and grateful heart is going to create some confusion when a woman is an equal colleague of a man at work, or a supervisor. Then what?As I say, worth reading if it doesn't change your mind in the slightest, or if it does."
0451125819,We the Living,,,,0/1,5.0,881712000,Fans of Ayn Rand shoud NOT overlook her first work,"Critics of Rand, when pointing to her more popular classics Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, often point out the exaggerated nature of the situations her characters are in. They suggest that Rand made her characters seem more heroic by creating unrealistic enemies and overblown conflicts.Yet, in We the Living, Rand can't be accused of hyperbole. Her most autobiographical novel, it tells the story of the young and ambitious Kyra Argounova, and her struggles to maintain her individualism in the tumultuous time of 1920's Soviet Russia. Readers will wisely note the similarities between Rand's own life and that of the character of Kyra.Although it may have been the novel that most successfully captured the struggle of life in Soviet Russia, the story is, as Rand points out, certainly not merely about the struggle of Kira to retain her freedom against the Communist Party, but rather, more generally, the struggle of the individual to retain their soul against the attempts of the state to strip it away.In response to Rand's critics, yes, this is her most realistic work of fiction. And that is exactly why it should not be overlooked. Ayn Rand experienced life under the thumb of the Communists first-hand, and this book captures it perfectly. There can be no claim of exagerated villains, because these villains were real.Simultaneously depressing, as we see freedom slowly being destoyed, and uplifting, as we see Kira struggle to live on, We the Living will challenge your ideas of politics, as all of Rand's novels do. Hopefully, after reading this book, you'll want to keep your politics to yourself, and understand why socialism will always be doomed to failure."

There are many great and important examples found in this book, both well and lesser known posters are showcased. Some parts of this book could described as egotistical going into the 50's and 60's as there are many M&uuml;ller-Brockmann works shown; however, I found this to be quite relevant with Swiss design of that time being so revolutionary. Then again I am a great admirer of his work. Additionally, the writings throughout the book are quite enlightening and are not too heavy to read. The printing quality is great, examples are large, shown in full colour and printed on very nice stock. The creator's name, size, year, type of reproduction, and descriptions of the purpose are included for each poster. One of the pro's to this book was the inclusion of these very brief descriptions. A very good piece of information to include in a design collective as it is essential in order to judge whether or not a piece of design is effective; something a few overrated books on identity could use (e.g. Los Logos)."

This is the first of the Salinas trilogy, and by some tastes, the funniest. Steinbeck captures a side of poverty to cause belly-laughs from the reader while never losing sight of the underlying environment of stark contrast from the 20th Century middle-class life experience of most of his readers. The author also manages to portray a type of machismo existing in a particular facet of some male Hispanics in an atmosphere both sympathetic and realistic. The characters of Tortilla Flat are the men the evening news of 2003 and the obituaries involving barroom stabbings comprise. Steinbeck illustrates a side of these characters most of affluent America humanity never sees and he does it without prejudice. I consider the Salinas trilogy to be the best of Steinbeck's otherwise valuable lifetime of contributions to American literature."

I never made it to the ""cat room"". I wandered into a ""miscellaneous pets"" area just off the entrance, and found cages of bunnies and ferrets and other creatures including a pair of bonded cockatiels. When I was a child, my grandmother raised love birds, and I had always wanted my own bird, but the presence of cats made that difficult. Currently catless, I decided to take the birds home. After I purchased two cages, and a few other things at the shelter, I made a trip to the local bird store for seed, pellets, cuttlefish bone, toys, and other assorted necessities the shelter folks recommended. When I told the proprietor of the bird store I was a new owner, she recommended COCKATIELS FOR DUMMIES.Over the past few weeks, I've been seeking all the information I can find about cockatiels. Although my daughter and daughter-in-law have pet birds (love birds, parakeets, and a dove) none of us knows much about cockatiels. Diane Grindol's approach to happy and healthy cockatiels includes advice about preventative health care maintenance, but she also provides plenty of suggestions for ways to bond with your bird. She gets down to the nitty gritty with: what to feed your bird and why; how to maintain his or her cage; why wing clipping, toenail trimming, and other grooming matters; what it means when a bird molts; how to distinguish between nutritious and poisonous plants; how to avoid bird hazards like scented candles, the toilet bowl and Teflon-lined pans; what to do if your boy bird masturbates on his food cup; and how to avoid reproduction without stressing the female, but the best tips involve how to have a good relationship with your birds.Grindol's book is perfect for a novice like me who knows plenty about wild birds but precious little about caged birds (actually two cages since the male was a bit hen-pecked so he spends part of the daylight hours in a separate establishment). So far, I am doing really well with my feathered friends who have a place of honor next to my PC (but far enough away they won't be radiated). If you're thinking about getting a bird, I suggest you read the DUMMIES book first. Birds require much more time than a cat, but for me it's worth it."

Watch out for Mac OS 10, as it is not clear that Fontog will run on it. Fontog will run OK on Mac OS 9. I finally found a copy at the Alibris site, so maybe they can dig up another copy (it will be expensive). As far as I have been able to find out (summer 2001) the publisher is not interested in a reissue or in selling the copyright.However, the more tricky you are with Fontographer, the more you need this book because it goes well beyond the software manual!

B0007J2JMG,Constantine and the conversion of Europe (Teach yourself history library),,A1FFV211MG0CW2,Mike Pettengill,1/2,5.0,1311811200,Was Constantine a Christian or an opportunist?,"A.H. M. Jones writes an admirable biography with negligible amounts of conjecture. Jones correctly states that we know little of Constantine's personal relationship with God. We possess historical evidence that outlines a vague conversion and details a somewhat sloppy and awkward evolution.Constantine who ruled an ever-growing portion of the Roman Empire until his death, in 337 AD, is best known for being the first Christian Roman Emperor, his Edict of Milan put an end to institutionalized persecution of Christians in the Empire. But, was Constantine a Christian or an opportunist?Constantine was a ruthless politician who killed rivals, subordinates and family members to ensure his own rise to power and popularity. It is his lifelong dedication to personal advancement at all costs that calls into question the legitimacy of his Christian conversion. Was he a Christian or did he simply realize that befriending the rapidly growing Christian population was a great opportunity to advance himself politically?It is known that Constantine was baptized only shortly before his death in 337. Some hypothesize that his ""deathbed conversion"" proves he did not walk with Christ. However, Jones points out that Constantine was merely following custom at the time which postponed baptism until old age or death.Constantine personally oversaw the Counsel of Nicea, which produced what we know today as bad theology. However, we must also acknowledge that Nicea produced better and more consistent theology then what existed at the time. A clear step in the right direction."

B000K0G43C,Fahrenheit 451,,AEW50V65A6ZO,Midnyte Reader,1/1,4.0,1348876800,Fahrenheit 451,"I admit I have never read this important book. Not even for school. Of course I knew what it was about because it is so iconic. A society where reading books is illegal and punishable. The way these criminal readers are punished? Burn not only their books, but their entire houses. Eeek.The story takes place mostly in the head of the main character Guy Montag. He is a fireman in a dystopian, alternate society. Fireman are responsible for burning things that are dangerous, case in point, books. But Guy has an awakening of conscience after meeting Clarissa, his teenage neighbor, who asks him questions that he is now forced to think about whether he likes it or not and after a woman decides to burn with her books.The story is a great deal of Montag's thoughts as he deals with his new views. They are written as a stream of conscience and there is very little container, although I could see the little house where he and his wife lived and his neighborhood and even the woods where he sought refuge. Some of the details were confusing to me at times, but they didn't take away from the context of the story.Bradbury's style is staccato and reminded me of the militant society in which the story took place. This made for powerful thoughts and ideas. It is emotional and sometimes just downright heartbreaking.The narrator is good, but I felt his voice and language a bit forced at times. I also think that for me, an audio book was the way to go for Fahrenheit 451. I'm not sure I would have been able to get out of it what I did had I been reading it myself.I can't say I enjoyed this book, but I'm glad I gave it a try. I find myself thinking about that alternate world, a world without books because different ideas are dangerous, because different views lead to trouble. Burn out anything that is politically incorrect or the least bit offensive and soon you have a sterile setting. In this world, only being entertained and pursuing pleasures are encouraged. The pursuit of philosophy will just make people unhappy because they will see how unfair life is.I like the character Clarissa, the young girl who had her mind and her eyes open. She is innocent and represents that in the way she asks questions and daydreams and wonders. I thought the wife Millie interesting because although it is apparent that she is unhappy, that she is aware something is wrong with this existence, she shuts it away and pretends everything is fine.I liked afterward by Bradbury who talks of editing and likens it to the reasons given in his book. He quotes ""There is more than one way to burn a book."" He also wrote a play re-visiting the characters of F-451 and said the one who revealed the most is Baty, the Fire Chief. Baty, it turns out, in this play has thousands of books. BUT, he never reads them. The law states you cannot read them, but it doesn't state you cannot have them. He diabolically lets them die because they are never read.This wasn't the easiest book to get through for me, but it is an important one that everybody, especially book lovers, should give a try."

I read the book and didn't enjoy it and felt many of the same emotions as the other kid who read it and said it was predictible and annoying. I breezed throught the book, often skimming, and was done, and dissapointed.Fast forward to the present day. I had been thinking about how The Great Gatsby is considered a classic, and how i didnt enjoy it at all. I decicded to read it again, carefully trying to asorb some meaning.And I found it.This book is really profound, a great work. The characters all fit together so well, and the story just takes you back to another time.If you are 14-18 years old, and just read this book to read it you wil not enjoy it. I think I just wans't mature enough to appreciate this work before. Don't judge this book by the first time you read it. Take the time to read it again and think about it; you will love it.A good analogy is how a diamond in the rough just looks like glass on the beach, sanded and hidden in a fog. Only when the diamond has been processed is its value apparent, and only when you take the time to process a book of this magnitude is it's value appreciable."

Coles spent a large portion of his life living amongst, interviewing, studying, and writing about volunteer community servants and the people for whom they work. The first 3/4 or so of this book recounts some of his favorite stories from that portion of his life. It does a fine job of doing so - these stories are the kind of thing you can't put down. The last 1/4 or so of the book tries to draw morals and conclusions from the stories. This part of the book is interesting too, and well written, but not quite as good as the first part of the book. For one thing, Coles tries to draw large-scale conclusions from non-randomly picked anecdotal cases. But his conclusions are still very interesting, and the book as a whole is really astonishingly good."

Human desires, principles, compromises, morality, amorality, and sexuality are all on display.The Spy Who Came in From the Cold set the standard for the multi-layered spy novel. As the story unfolds, the reader must attempt to decide what is really going on. Is Alec Leamas really a defector or on a covert deception mission? Does he really know fully what he is doing? Is East German counter-intelligence master, the despicable Mundt, the target of the deception or is he really an English spy? Is it a double-game? A triple-play?

No wonder students drop out of college and feel they are wasting their money. America is producing some fabulous literature yet there is an old guard that clings to all that is bleak in life. May I recommend Victor Frankle&#8217;s Man&#8217;s Search for Meaning? This is a much better and true account of the human spirit and what it can accomplish.

A series of around 40 interviews of people living in conditions which are difficult for much of &quot;Middle England&quot; to believe, let alone understand. The histories of these people, from the desperate and depressed (&quot;An end sixteen floors below&quot;) to those delighted to be given the opportunities to live a life (&quot;Love it, this little place&quot;), are enough to make the reader cry and laugh, depending on the interview.The way Tony Parker gets people to talk is incredible, and the unwinding of the people's lives over the series of interviews is both awful and totally compelling.In an age where docu-soaps are all the rage on television, this book should still be in print. The written word acts a deeper record of the lives of these people than any screen could ever do, and the stories told are sufficient to deeply move the reader.Anyone serious about understanding the behaviour of people in the UK, and the problems that the working (and not-working) classes face, must read this book. Whether Left-wing or Right-wing in outlook, the reader will be challenged and encouraged by this portrait of urban life in the latter half of the twentieth century"

The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature.

Unfortunately, his laconic, laid back style hinders the suspense in this novel. Charley's back (from &quot;Tidewater Blood&quot;), and his character is not one of my favorites. Although he was done wrong in the first book by his own family, his retreat into a fantasy, anchorite's world only makes him irritating. His desire to leave the world behind, live in the wild and avoid people may be idealistic but still unrealistic, too. He's hooked up with Blackie, a woman with a criminal record, and his relationship with her forms a strong foundation for what drives a lot of the story. The mystery surrounding the mysterious death of Aunt Jessie takes a back seat to Charley's own obstinance and lack of perception. His sudden act of infidelity only shows how shallow he can be, and his decision to keep it from Blackie leads to the inevitable dissolution of their relationship. It doesn't take long to figure out the culprits in this one.Although not an exceptional book, Hoffman's skills make it one worth reading; let's hope he picks up the pace in future novels."

The things that went on disgust me and tear at my heart, but for some reason I'm also very intrigued by what occurred in all of those concentration and extermination camps. I first read Night a couple months ago- I didn't realize just how horrible the events that Elie described were, until I read the book a couple weeks ago for a second time. The traumatic experiences that Elie describes are enough to make your heart ache, but at the same time, he does not go overboard in detailing the more gruesome cruelties. That is one reason why I like this book. I also like it because of the informal manner in which it's written- they are just Elie's words, his memories- he doesn't need to spell everything out or spend time recapping who the characters are, because they are not characters- the people were real. If you are a fan of Holocaust books, I would definitely recommend that you read Night at least once in your lifetime."

For all Codi Noline's attempts to dissociate from others, her pain is there for us to share. The very fact that Kingsolver doesn't let Codi acknowledge, let alone wallow in, her pain is precisely what makes it so available to the reader.The action is minimal. Nothing blows up. But one thing leads logically to another, and there is plenty of character-driven drama and suspense. The only thing I'd change about the book is that it gets a little preachy here and there.

The first time I read it, I was about 17 years old living in Russia. Anything American was good. The book was translated into Russian but somehow was not very popular. No one could really understand what it was all about. If it was about the WWII, it was at least strange. If it was an American humor, there was nothing to laugh about. It was not funny to bomb your own planes. And how could a captain walk around naked? Tomatoes, prostitutes, the CID men, crazy officers and nurses... People did not like it.Than I came to America and a few years later, I saw this book used, somewhere, and just for 10 cents. I could not resist. I read it again. I could speak some English back than but I guess it was not enough to understand the full depth of Catch-22. I liked it better than before, in Russia, but still not enough. It was just OK.A month ago, I was making more room for books in my house. Books, I did not care much about were destined to end their lives in the local library, as my donation. Catch-22 by Joseph Heller... I opened it again. What a mistake. What a surprise. I was stunned. It was one of the best books ever written. One has to know not only the language but the life in America and the Americans as well to understand this book completely. This book is not about the war. This book is about us and our lives and our regular affairs. This book is perfect and has to be an American classic. No, Catch-22 did not go to the local library. It is destined now to end its life on my shelf. I will have to read it again and, only than, again and again. Have you read it? You have to read it."
1401862713,Game Development Essentials: An Introduction,,A2M1822I8YNGPZ,Dave Coleman,9/11,3.0,1330473600,Solid Intro Textbook,"This book creates a good foundation for learning about the modern game development process. Overall, I am happy with the book, and would recommend it to a beginner or as a quick read to fill in the gaps of an intermediate developer. I do have three complaints, however.First off, it reads like a textbook. Take a few minutes to read the sample chapter. I thought the nature of that chapter forced the dryness of the reading, but the entire book reads this way. Be prepared for this, and structure your reading time accordingly.Second, the author frequently includes quotes from various people in the field. I think this is excellent, and I wish more authors would do this. However, the author also includes a paragraphs with the person's credentials in-line with the text before the quote. The completely destroys the flow of the content, and severely distracts from the subject matter being presented.Lastly, the frequent references to other books in the series makes this book feel like a marketing pamphlet. I understand this Introduction book is limited in scope, but a single page at the beginning of the book that references the other in-depth books would be more helpful. The in-line self-advertisements were irritating, and just make it harder to find them later if I actually want to dig up that book.As I said previously, I would recommend this book. It's a solid intro to the topics at hand. If you go into it prepared for the above distractions, and with the understanding that this book is an overview and not a deep-dive, you should be able to maximize what you get from this book."

B000L2L8VM,Kon-tiki,,,,10/11,5.0,928800000,An eye opener to a lost age of adventure,"This is an immensely inspiring account of human adventure and perseverance. It sets man against sea, thin odds against practical ingenuity, conventional academic thought against the independent thinker. This four thousand mile journey across barren, treacherous seas can't help but inspire the would-be adventurer. The adventurers' single mindedness and determination, in the face of naysaying world experts (who said they would never succeed, and that their boat would sink at mid-sea), shows how determination and perseverance can lead to accomplishing what some may view as impossible goals, and in so doing it pushes the boundaries and commonplace notions of what is possible. We see that not all adventurous fools and are so foolish; that determination can see one across a massive barren and stormy ocean, real or metaphorical. On completing the book, all that remains is for the reader to respond to its call for adventure and begin plans for achieving personal goals or adventures ... all the tools needed for accomplishment are demonstrated in this voyage. In a corporate world where too often money is the primary force in leading us to act, where the value of an activity is measured by its potential financial payback, it is refreshing to be reminded of other motivations for action, and of other rewards. Can this book reawaken a spirit of adventure which may seem irrelevant to modern social or commercial life? Can it remind us how to dream and the virtues of following our dreams? I am reminded in these pages how, why, and where I can find adventure ... one walks away from the book convinced that anything is possible, should I choose to look beyond conventional thought or lifestyle and reach for the stars."

B000KPTZI8,The Black Dahlia,,A969IW9IS7IH6,Thomas Bohnstedt,1/2,4.0,937440000,Good read,"Author John Gilmore was a bit more lenient towards his portrayal of Elisabeth Short's personality in his book ""Severed"", than was James Ellroy, who takes the jaded view of Beth Short, the ""Black Dahlia""; that Beth was a tramp and maybe a whore. Perhaps she was. Ellroy's Beth is a girl who told too many lies to too many of the wrong people to get what she needed. In trying to attain her goals, Beth gave herself away, or sold herself, to the wrong people, and it caught up with her, ending in her brutal torture and murder, and one of the most notorious crimes in modern history.James Ellroy also pulls us with him, head-first, into the seamy side of the police culture; a culture where the good guys are sometimes the bad guys, and yet still manage to convince themselves that they are somehow superior to ""civilians"".The story was intriguing, and kept me guessing, despite clues that author Ellroy left in the book. This is how a mystery is supposed to work; the clues are there, but they don't present themselves to you in an obvious manner AS clues.James Ellroy did a good job of weaving his fictional tale around the real-life crime of the Beth Short murder. The only flaw may be in the murder victim's anatomy: If John Gilmore's information about autopsy records is correct, then a plot which makes Elisabeth Short into a prostitute or porn actress might have problems. This is assuming of course that Gilmore's information is correct.Aside from that, it is a good read, as Mr. Ellroy takes us through the Los Angeles of the 1940's; not the glamorous, palm tree LA of nostalgia, but the realistic, and sometimes unpleasant, LA of the real world, even in the 1940s."
B000P9ZQPU,Pope Joan,,AX5JVLYKT3V6K,Goddess of the World,3/5,5.0,1014422400,Enthralling,"I picked this book up on a whim because, as a Catholic woman, it was a truly fascinating concept. I heard the legendgrowing up, but passed it off as a fairy tale. I never imagined that I would learn so much while being taken on such an incredible ride. This is not a story about horrible men holding back a woman. It is the story of a woman making choices that go against society norms... and thriving while dealing with the ramifications of her choices. The historical aspects are well researched, but presented in proper context without being dry and mundane. A few historical liberties were taken out of necessity for the development of the story; however, Cross did not blatantly rewite history. I was reminded at times of other authors who have created another time period for me through their writing (most notably recently would be Gabaldon in her &quot;Outlander&quot; series. Even though the genres are very different for &quot;Outlander&quot; and &quot;Pope Joan&quot;, the times and stories pulled me in and made me feel like I was there)."
B000MAH7HM,Into the Night (Troubleshooter),,,,5/12,1.0,1076457600,NOT EVEN ONE STAR,"Wow did I pick up the wrong book. The subplots were fairly decent. Mary Lou was the most compelling character in the book as she struggles to grow up, shed her excessive baggage, do the right thing and get her priorities straight. She certainly had much more compassion and caring for Donny than his own sister, Joan. The Vince/Charlotte story was a nice one but I find it most unlikely that a woman like her and in her 80s would be using such terms as &quot;pissed off&quot;. The main storyline about Joan and Mike was absolutely the most ridiculous thing I have ever read. In actuality I skipped through pages and pages of their frivolous, uninteresting (filler)banter. Unfortunately the author chose to write in this age difference conflict. She then proceeded to paint Joan as chronologically 7 or 8 years older than Mike but with a maturity level at least 10 years younger than his 25. What's the point then? Joan is a shallow, silly, self-centered, sewer-mouthed unlikeable character. As for Mike Muldoon, I found him rather bland and unbelievable in his attraction to this woman. The book started out with about a 15 page wonderful action sequence but that was it except for a few pages at the end of the book. I got the impression there was going to be lots of SEAL action. No more Brockmann for me thank you."

You can look at the Book of Mormon and see how interconnected the book is with names, dates, and places, not only in the book itself, but also in the Bible, and other records that have come forth AFTER the book was translated which support the truth of the book. Not only that, but Joseph Smith, the translator of The Book of Mormon, never had more formal than a third grade education. Could someone do that without God's help? Of course not. Then, on a spiritual view, read the book and ask God if He inspired it, and if it is true. He, the source of all truth, will tell you that it is, as He did to me. This book changed my life. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. (By the way, you can get a free copy by ordering it from [...])"
B0006VUD6E,North,,APFWAOMW6XK6,Walter Nicolau,18/18,4.0,977875200,Witness devastation,"In this partly autobiographical novel, we find Celine on the run through Baden Baden, a bombed out Berlin, and finally a small village at the outskirts of the remains of the Third Reich capital, on his way to what he hesitantly calls a refuge, during the chaos and total insanity of the final stages of the second world war.Celine does not really complain the misery of his fate. In his cynical manner, he merely records his incredible encounters with seemingly all the renegades and twised characters of a scorched Europe and willing or not he witnesses the atrophies and deformities of human mind. Ironically, the author somehow manages to turn his characters into hillarious and amiable, even entertaining figures.Celine writes like no other writer you have read. His truncated sentences, in bits and pieces all over the place, remind of a rather maniac mind spinning thoughts at the speed of light in an incohomprensive, bordering to delirious babble. That's Celine all right throughout North. In poignant remarks, making fun, laughing at himself, expressing same anxiety, bitternes, and cynical observations as in his other writings, Celine moves on, weary but undefeated. Life goes on."

After 1200 years of life, the last 150 of which have been spent in constant torture, this werewolf king in Paris NEEDS his mate. He scents her high on the streets above him and must go to her. But when he finds Emmaline he's shocked to find that she is a vampire, the very species which has imprisoned him.Emmaline is just a co-ed from Tulane touring around Paris trying to find out who her mom & dad were. Yes, she is a vampire- or atleast partly one. She's also a Valkyrie and was raised by her warrior aunts. When the growling crazy guy tackles her on the streets of Paris she freaks! Who wouldn't?

Rice ""LCI Book Reviews""",3/3,5.0,1250208000,Jesuits and Ignatius on an Ancient-Future Kind of Leader,"First I'll let you know I am a raving fan of this book.Second, I am enormously influenced by the Jesuit approach to spiritual formation.Third, my profession has to do with leadership development.Finally, I am always looking for how to improve the process, the delivery system, the content, the relational engagements and the outcomes when I design leadership training environments.Oh, by the way, I am not a Jesuit and I am not Roman Catholic. I am an evangelical Protestant who is deeply appreciative of a variety of religious traditions and grateful for help I can find in different traditions.The book, Heroic Leadership: Best Practices From a 450 Year Old Company That Changed the World, by Chris Lowney (a former Jesuit) is rich in ideas, insights, illustrations and a ""system"" that was designed by Ignatius of Loyola in the mid-1500's.In a nutshell, Lowney organizes the Jesuit genius around four organizing pillars that are not individual pillars, but which weave together in a synergistic whole where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.Here are the four pillars: (1) Self-Awareness and the reordering of one's inner world, (2) Ingenuity and the ability to radically innovate in a changing world, (3) Love as essential to a worldview that generates the resonance of emotional intelligence, (4) Heroism and having great desires, great resolves. Put these together and you have a process for helping people run full speed into perfection. The Jesuits went way beyond good, they stopped briefly at great and then soared on to atmospheric heights above that. They were truly one of the greatest missional organizations ever created.Lowney explains each of these pillars clearly. He provides historical examples of the Jesuits in action who illustrate these pillars. Rabbit Trail Note: I really like these historical examples for I am involved in cross cultural missional work and I love history. If neither of those are of interest to you, you can skim through those sections. Not that I would advise doing that... but you can. Second Rabbit Trail Note: If you ever saw the movie The Mission with Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons, read chapter 8 to get some of the historical and political background and then watch the movie again.Lowney also pulls into his book, themes from the Spiritual Exercises. For someone who is not familiar with the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius, you won't fully benefit from his allusions to them. I have gone through the Exercises and am currently going through them again. Lowney gave me some new windows to appreciate the greatness of the Exercises and actually expanded my vision on their usefulness. I now see them, not just as spiritually formative exercises, but as leadership forming exercises.For me, the desired outcome of reading a book is that I come away with ideas for change, motivation to do so and a few practical ideas for how to run full speed toward perfection. Chris Lowney has provided all of that and more.Brian RiceLeadership ConneXtions International[...]"

9626346787,Madame Bovary (Classic Fiction),22.98,A3I5UO50TMIZ04,J. Clark,0/2,3.0,1239753600,Good - Not Great,"I purchased this novel after hearing so much about how influential it is and how it may be the perfect novel. In capturing Realism or being a classic demonstration of Victorian Age style and values, it does succeed; but in terms of creating an emotional bond with the reader or creating deep characters, it fails.The first couple chapters are a little odd since they spend most of the time giving the reader the background of Charles Bovary, which tried to give the reader some idea of how his mind works, but never quite makes him come to life. After he meets his future wife, Emma, he pretty much becomes a piece of furniture in the background of her story. The author successfully describes the slow boring pace of provincial life in mid-1800 France by boring us with two dimensional characters, some of which talk non-stop.Really the only thing that the reader can sink their teeth into is Emma Bovary's naive, mercurial, and over romanticized behavior. The woman has no moral scruples, no grasp of reality, and goes through such wild mood swings that the reader could easily guess that she is mentally ill. Poor Charles has no idea any of this is coming as he, like the reader, has no idea she is this unhinged from our first encounters with her. The reader is taken on a wild ride that spirals out of control until her life and the life of her doting husband end in complete tragedy.Pros:1. If you like the all too quaint works of the Brontes and Wharton you'll probably like this story.2. Descriptive narration when it comes to scenery3. Two characters in this book really stand out. The Apothecary has non-stop mouth that makes you want to slap him; and the emotionally infantile Emma Bovary.4. Is the gold standard for Victorian era writing (such as it is.)Cons:1. Only the two characters stand out and have any sort of depth. Most are stereotypical caricatures.2. The book would be a few dozen pages shorter without the Apothecary.3. For all the talk about scandal and affairs, this story could be read by a elementary school child and not offend them. If it wasn't for Bovary talking about the affairs, I would have been sure she had them.4. I didn't really care when I finished reading it. I didn't want to know more about the characters or want to look for more of the author's work.Bottom Line: If you're literary glutton should should probably read this book just because. For men, this book can be very instrumental in defining that the term ""damaged goods"" means when it come to women. For women, let Bovary's bad-girl antics and miserable end speak for themselves."
B000GSB9M4,Mere Christianity,,A1DAQOI9N8L4R3,Jason Pratt,2/8,4.0,1037664000,"Not the end-all, be-all, even of Lewis' work; but still okay","Not really the best Christian apologetic Lewis ever wrote: that would be his 1960 revision of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_, in conjunction with his much earlier _The Problem of Pain_ (which should be read after MaPS).Still, MC is very accessible to many readers. The chapters of the first two sections were originally designed to be ""Broadcast Talks"" (the original title of the first publication of the first section) on BBC radio during WWII. They provide a colorful version (if somewhat oversimplified, as Lewis well knew) of the theistic Argument from Morality, which does help to introduce the principles within and around the argument; and, for section 2, a variation of what has come to be called the Lewis Trilemma (aka 'Liar, Lunatic, or Lord?').The Trilemma is also oversimplified (keep in mind the broad target audience), and should not be considered to be Lewis' ultimate opinion on the subject; but unfortunately he never seems to have written a more technical version. (Some even more foreshortened versions can be found in other articles and essays he wrote.) In any event, although it is tempting to deride Lewis for simply presuming that the texts are sufficiently accurate to make such a judgment, any critic (pro or con) ought to know from other writings that Lewis was well aware of the benefits and limitations (and abuses) of textual criticism. Besides, the attempt to call into question the honesty of the textual authors/editors merely ends up reinstituting the Trilemma again at the next level. The Trilemma cannot easily be brushed aside: as the increasingly complex (and spurious) historical revisionism theories of the past 30 years (forms of which Lewis was already familiar with from his own day and prior) ironically testify.This doesn't mean that the Trilemma argument is rock-solid, either, however. It isn't a substitute for preliminary philosophical argument; nor is it a substitute for historical analysis. It perhaps works best as the very tail end of one (or ideally both) of those endeavors. Dr. Gregory Boyd makes much the same point very well in _Cynic Sage or Son of God_ (an indepth analysis of the logical bona fides of various historical propositions): if Jesus was like _that_, then we have a fairly straightforward explanation for why the earliest existant texts about him are like _this_--an explanation that doesn't require (for instance) hypothesizing about what a hypothetical community did not believe based on what a hypothetical 'early strata' of a hypothetical document hypothesized to have been used by this hypothetical community does _not_ say. |g| (As Boyd pithly observes: _that_ requires faith! Lewis, who had already seen numerous similar attempts at historical revisionism in his day, even outside Jesus-studies, would agree.)As always, careful qualification should be observed, pro or con: and it is admittedly worth noting, that due to certain restrictions in his delivery, Lewis is not as carefully qualified as he could be. (i.e., this is a necessarily truncated _introduction_ to the topic, not the final word on it.)The AfM in Section 1, remember, is also not rigorously proposed. (Although it is more thorough than the chapter on morality in MaPS, again for a good reason in relation to the structure of that greater work.) Unfortunately, again, Lewis never wrote a rigorous (specifically theistic) AfM--possibly because he believed that no total weight would hang adequately on it (there is some indication of this in how he uses it to make a restrained and subordinate point in MaPS). _The Abolition of Man_ (and a few essays here and there which presage it) does not exactly take up the slack as a theistic AfM--although, once again, this is because Lewis didn't design it to. (See my review of TAoM.)The remaining two sections (also originally published separately) form the majority of the book. The 3rd section, on 'Christian Morality', is again a useful and enjoyable (if very basic) introduction to the subject, both at a theological and historical level, in the sense of: 'This is the consistency of the subject in relation to Christian philosophy, and this is (a very basic) overview of how Christian thinkers have tended to most cogently consider the matter.'The final section, on the doctrine of the Trinity, is the best popular introduction to the subject I know.Both last sections (3 and 4) can work well at helping readers, both believer and sceptic, to clear away some misconceptions concerning those two topics (the generally-Christian moral code, and the trinitarian doctrine). Unfortunately, theories on those topics are widespread and different enough, that confusion may result if these are taken to be _the_ foundational base of understanding for future reading; especially in the case of the Trinity. Still, as aids to practical application of the relevant doctrines, they make excellent introductions."

Not as mesmerizing as All The President's Men, but still, a great and worthy effort by Bob Woodward. There was a critique about this book here that said his widow's book was better, because Judy Belushi knew John better than anyone. While I agree with that, I will add that Judy was as high as John was during their relationship. Also, this author of the critique (who hales from the UK), does not know John Belushi, so, in essence, does not have the faintest clue what John Belushi was really like. I think Wired was too rough on her idol, and she refuses to think he acted as wild as he did. I like Elvis Presley, I know had a wild streak in him, I don't refuse to accept it though.As for Wired.

All of these are fictional novels based on British Admiralty records of the Napoleonic era. Written in the best tradition of Forester and O'Brien, these books will capture our imagination. And if you haven't read the Hornblower series by Forester, or the Aubrey/Maturin series by O'Brien, try them also. All of these are excellent books that you will treasure and reread. I particularly like these books by Pope. I recommend that you buy them all at once and read them in order. You will be glad you did.If you enjoy reading accurate descriptions of naval maneuvers in the age of sail, or simply a good adventure yarn, Dudley Pope delivers. Pope conveys how the best of the best, handle emergency situations. He portrays these situations with realism and authenticity.Review of this book:In this novel, Ramage awakes after receiving an injury in battle to find himself in command of the rapidly sinking Sibella. The pace is fast and furious as he struggles to complete the Sibella's mission and save his crew. As any Captain who has lost his ship, this book concludes with Ramage facing a daunting courts martial board with the deck stacked against him.*************************************************"

0152003533,A Break with Charity: A Story about the Salem Witch Trials,,A3DBESS6PEWRDJ,"SocrLuvr92 ""Hannah Reed""",3/3,4.0,1116374400,A must read book!,"This story of the Salem Witch Trials is told fourteen years later from a young women's point of view, remembering her life in Salem, Massachusetts in the 1700's. Discovering the accusing of witches in her area, Susannah is left with a decision to join the group of accusers, and risk her family being accused, or to not tell at all and let the accused be hanged. I was attracted to this book that it is about the Salem Witch Trials. I am very interested in this topic, and I wanted to know about the feeling of the accused and such and this book gave me a really good sense of the feelings of everyone, from the accused, to the afflicted. The main characters of the book are: Susannah, a girl in her late teens who knows the story behind the afflicted. Father, Susannah's father, who was accused (but his real name was not mentioned in the book.) William, Susannah's brother who went on a voyage as Susannah awaits his return. Goody Bibber, the elderly lady who scares Susannah by telling her things of which she thinks are going to happen in the future. And finally, the Circle, which consists of Mary Walcott, Elizabeth Booth, Susanna Sheldon, Betty Parris, and Abigail Williams, all of which were afflicted. My opinion about this book, that it is very interesting. I loved the way it is set up. There is a lot of dialogue, and I think that helps because you can see everyone's view on a situation. I would rate this book a medium read. It's not easy enough to understand by only reading a few pages at a time, but it isn't so hard that you have to look up words you don't understand. What I mean by this is if you don't understand a word, usually the sentence describes it enough that you can just move on. I would definitely recommend this book, but probably only to an audience of mature level. Also, an audience that enjoys suspense would be good for this book. A lessen taught in this book is to never hold in something important that it could save someone's life because in the end, it could hurt you more than it would originally by telling in the first place."
B000N7ATOC,Adoption Nation: How the Adoption Revolution Is Transforming America,,A3JPC4APEQHEVD,Cara Jacobs,2/4,2.0,1060387200,Adoption Nation,"Adoption Nation provides an interesting historical and sociological account of adoption. However, the author has a very clear bias and is not afraid to let it show throughout the book. He presents important facts, many of which I have not found in other books, however he does not fail to insert his own opinion about these facts in every place possible. If you agree with Mr. Pertman that absolutely open adoption is the only healthy alternative, international adoption is misguided, and that non-traditional families are morally incorrect when they wish to adopt healthy children (as Mr. Pertman and his wife did), then you will read this book without cringing. If, like me, you disagree with any of any of his very clear biases, then you will find his lack of journalistic objectivity disappointing."

It is the story of a young woman who must endure the turmoil of revolution and the imposition of a totalitarian state &amp; who ultimately risks everything for freedom. Don't avoid this novel just because you don't like objectivism (this was written before she started her philosophical movement) or you'll definitely be missing out on one of the best novels of the 20th century."
B00088BMEM,A tale of two cities,,A3UV1YAIA3WCOV,John Lien,0/0,4.0,1271721600,A Riveting Story,"Charles Dickens creates a captivating story about the French Revolution in the novel A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens uses numerous literary devices including mood, foreshadowing, and imagery to create a novel that captures readers from the beginning. The dynamic characters featured in the story, including Madame Defarge and Sydney Carton, help create a unique and exciting novel for that time period. Dickens creatively shows the horrors and tragedies of the French Revolution, while also describing the viciousness of the revolutionaries. The insightful quotes taken from this book prove that this is a timeless classic. The theme of resurrection and exciting twists to the plot up until the very end give readers a wonderful book to enjoy. What can be considered one of the highlights of the story, the vivid imagery Dickens successfully uses to develop mood, foreshadowing, and other literary devices and concepts make A Tale of Two Cities even more interesting. This deep novel takes much analysis to understand, but it is a worthwhile and important book that should be read."

0815702035,Keeping the Compound Republic: Essays on American Federalism,17.59,A2C5F4L00Y9XW9,Matthew P. Arsenault,3/5,4.0,1130025600,Evolution of American Federalism,"I gathered from Derthick's essays that American federalism, to a point, is a fluid institution. The battle between state's rights and federal authority is ongoing. Although the general trend is an increasing level of national supremacy, neither the state, nor the federal government has yet or will possess the power to secure a monopoly of control. I found most interesting the impact of the Supreme Court and the Progressive Era on changes in American federalism.In discussing the Supreme Court, it is necessary to point out that its impact has ebbed and flowed in regards to state's rights and federal authority. For example, under the Warren court, decisions were passed down which limited the right of individual states to govern their own affairs in a sovereign manner. The author cites a number of court decisions as illustrations of the imposition of federal will over state self-governance. Two famous cases are Miranda v. Arizona and Brown v. Board of Education. In both cases, the Court imposed a national will upon the decisions of the state.As stated above, the impact of the Supreme Court on federalism does not flow in one direction. Under the late William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court began to hand down decisions that placed a greater influence on the rights of states to govern their own affairs without the pressure of federal authority. Two important cases illustrating the general feeling towards federalism by the Rehnquist court are Brown v. Thomson, which dealt with state apportionment plans, and San Antonio v. Rodriguez, which dealt with equality between schools. In both cases, the Court found in favor of the states handling their own affairs without the influence of federal authority.A second impact on the fluid nature of American federalism was the Progressive Era. Derthick writes, ""The Progressive Era advanced a new way of thinking about federalism, grounded less in constitutional law than in conceptions of community and political ideology"" (106). I found this interesting due to the attack on the Constitution. Rather than adhere to a literal reading of the Constitution, Progressives argued for interpretation of the words of the founding fathers. The Constitution held that the United States was ""an indestructible Union composed, of indestructible States"" (106).The Progressives, however, attempted to create a national community rather than one separated by state boarders. In order to do so, the Progressives launched a movement which offered a new interpretation of the Constitution, rather than a strict reading. This interpretation focused on the importance of a national consensus. The good of the nation, should surpass the individual desires of those in a particular state. J. Allen Smith, quoted in Derthick writes, ""A constitution can not be regarded as a check upon the people themselves...(but) the means of securing the supremacy of public opinion and not an instrument of thwarting it...(the Constitution) must yield readily to changes in public opinion"" (108).Although the Supreme Court and the Progressive Era are not the only sculptors of American federalism, their impact cannot be ignored. The interactions between the two, and among each's subsequent part, the fluidity and malleability of the American federal system becomes apparent."

1573929212,Reincarnation: A Critical Examination,20.14,A2YI7D9LC6WI0H,Jeff Danelek,14/22,3.0,982022400,A man with an ax to grind,"As a recent convert to reincarnation, I approached Mr. Edward's book with more than a little trepidation. After all, I had just abandoned 20 years of traditional Christianity for my new belief system and I had been hoping to hold onto it for a little while. My fears proved to be unfounded, however, as Edwards quickly demonstrates himself to be but another arrogant debunker with a quick wit and a generally poor understanding of reincarnation. At least, I think his understanding of it is poor as there isn't much of the book devoted to discussing the mechanics of the idea; rather, Edwards spends the bulk of his time attacking various proponents of the concept. Two entire chapters are dedicated to Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, another to Dr. Stanislav Grof, and yet another to Dr. Ian Stevenson (other major proponents of the concept also receive considerable ink.) Obviously, Mr. Edwards has quite the ax to grind and grind away he does-with obvious pleasure and good humor. Unfortunately, this attempt to discredit the messenger does little to tarnish the message. Even the most flawed prophets can have their fingers on the pulse of truth, even if they prove themselves occasionally to be poor judges of character or prone to bouts of sensationalism. In those rare parts of the book where Edwards does attempt to deal with the mechanics of reincarnation, I found some of his objections to be thought provoking and clever, but I found most to be pedestrian at best, and a few to border on the childish (where do astral bodies get their clothes? C'mon, Paul, show some respect!) Additionally, his repudiation of karma as a purely punitive system of retribution demonstrates his simplistic understanding of the concept. He deals with only one concept-and the most primitive at that-of how karma works without bothering to explore more sophisticated ideas that perceive it as a largely self-imposed instructional system designed to further a soul's spiritual development. Considering Mr. Edwards fervent devotion to classical materialism, one could easily get the idea that Paul's chief problem is not that reincarnation isn't true, but that it mustn't be true. Oh, I almost forgot: he also tries to show us why there is no God either, just in case we suspected him of latent spirituality. Despite all these problems, however, I still give Paul Edwards' book three stars as it does attempt to address a few issues that need further thought and refining by reincarnationists, and is a good-if occasionally ponderous-read. I hope if anyone else ever decides to tackle the issue in the future, though, they will do so with less condescension and arrogance than does Mr. Edwards. Respect for anothers beliefs is an important requirement if any dialogue is to be fruitful, although I suspect Paul is far less interested in convincing reincarnationists to abandon their beliefs than he is in impressing his fellow skeptics at Prometheus Books."

On his honeymoon, tokens of his continuing love affair shows up in Camilla photos falling from his diary and cuff-links(two C's connecting).The new Princess of Wales is rightfully hurt and confused.This behavior of Charles hardly gets the marriage off to a good start.Throughout the marriage, Diana is witness to numerous occasions where Charles(through actions or words) declares his never-ending love for a married woman and continues with his adultery.Charles and Camilla showed as much disregard for Andrew Parker-Bowles' feelings as they did for Diana.What is especially upsetting is that rather than publicly admit he was a heartless, cheating man, Charles continued to portray himself as a loving husband to Diana and a respectable man who would one day be crowned king. He was willing to let his subjects believe he was an honorable man.Not only is the future king a cad, he is a liar as well!Besides there is NO evidence showing Diana as metally ill, un-balanced or anything before her association with Charles. As for her tantrums, I would site inmaturity and sheer frustration as the reasons for her outbursts.Diana was a normal, sane, healthy young woman prior to her engagement. Her bulminia did not start until after she moved to Buckingham Palace and she realized she was a Lamb to the Slaughter. It was then she realized her future husband did not love her and was very much committing adultery with a married woman. Adultery was something that Charles would continue to practice throughout their marriage.What is equally the mark of a cad, is Charles even cheated on his mistress!To write a book that basically white-washes Charles' moraless antics, is a disgrace and an insult to everyone's itelligence.He is a Villain if I ever saw one!!!!!"

His style may not suit everyone: the pace can be quick and he often gives you brief allusions to things you never hear much more about. It's a part of the way he creates a world, by giving his characters a story and a history beyond that which is set down in the actual novel.Zelazny didn't always get it right - for example, I found ""Eye of Cat"" very hard to follow - but I think he's done it perfectly in ""Lord of Light"". It gives a powerful beauty and poignancy to both the beginning and the end of the novel, while the imagination and presentation of the magic/technology remains as consistent and fresh today as when he wrote the novel in the 1960s.

Howell ""neogalahad""",23/25,5.0,1192838400,A must-read for all Christian parents,"""We don't understand how our son John could be living such a wicked life! We raised him in church and did everything right!"" Ever hear these words uttered by godly parents in your church? The sad fact is that they probably DID do most things right -- except lead little Johnny to genuine salvation. As Ray Comfort emphasizes in this small book, bringing your children to Christ (and keeping them there) involves far more than a ""sinner's prayer"" at age four.Those already familiar with Comfort's ministry will recognize his message here. Most of the book focuses on teaching your children about God's Law to bring conviction of sin so that they will recognize that they are guilty before God and need a Savior. As in most of his other works, Comfort uses the Ten Commandments to show that we are indeed individually guilty of sinning against God's holy Law. Only when we realize this can we repent and humbly accept the free gift of salvation through Christ.What's different in this book is that Comfort shows how to communicate these truths on a child's level, often suggesting helpful visual aids and object lessons. For example, how do you sensitively tell a young child what it means to commit adultery? Comfort also warns about the dangers of prematurely leading a child to ""salvation"", since children usually want to please Mommy & Daddy and can easily be manipulated into doing something they don't understand (producing the ""false conversion"" of the book's subtitle). His do's and don't's are very practical.The rest of the book deals with other fairly basic guidelines for raising godly kids, such as:**Making sure our lives back up what we say (since children are very sensitive to hypocrisy),**Guarding against worldly influences -- sinful entertainment, wrong friends, and the humanistic indoctrination of public schools (AMEN!),**Having daily family devotions,**Warning your kids about the dangers of alcohol, smoking, and immorality, and**Letting your kids observe your concern for the lost.There are other great books on Christian child rearing that go into much more detail, but this little classic is foundational. I firmly believe that God is powerfully using Ray Comfort to call the church back to true biblical evangelism. I highly recommend this book -- it would make a great gift for any believing parents-to-be!"

B000J6DLBU,MOBY DICK or THE WHALE,,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,Kendal B. Hunter,2/6,4.0,1005004800,"It deserves 5 *'s, except for the long narrative! (Read On!)","This is an unquestionably classic. Indeed, you know a classic by how many times it has been ripped off, or alluded to in pop culture. In fact, the star Trek franchise's motto is when in doubt; either have a time travel episode, a Borg episode, or rip-off Moby-Dick. See episodes from the original series &quot;Obsession,&quot; and movies &quot;The Wrath of Khan,&quot; and &quot;First Contact&quot; and &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;Test: What's the opening line of Moby-Dick? &quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot;So why the four starts for a classic? Basically, because Melvin threw in too much exposition in explaining cetology and zoology, which is helpful in getting a feel for the book, but contributes nothing to the brooding Ahab's story. You get snippets here and there of Ahab's monomania, but it is only in the last several chapters that he blooms from being a poor addled man to a diabolic and satanic force of evil. Baptizing the spear in the name of the devil is what does it!But do we need to slog through 135 chapters, plus an appendix to get to the point. In reality this book is about the milieu of whaling and the whaling industry as a metaphor for life, not monomania as is popularly believed. He does a wonderful job of catching the salt and blood associated, and his poetic eye catches the glisten of meaning with these events, but he is doing several things at once, and the quest for the whale is only part of the story.But these cetology matters should have been relegated to an appendix, or the circular file. It was as if Melville was trying to write two books at once: a bouncy book on various whales and whaling in general, and a another being the tale of obsession and revenge. My advice would be to get an abridge version of the book, or skip to the next chapter when the book gets boring.So what is the appeal? First, Ahab is a strong character with a smoldering motive to get back at the whale that cost him his leg-i.e. Captain Hook. Does he ever get back at the wale? Are we ever Ahab-esque in that we get obsessed with revenge? Come on! Be honest! We feel Ahab burning in our veins at times.Ahab is crazy. Hannibal Lecter is crazy. But they are crazy for different reasons. You feel that Lecter is really in control of himself, and that he enjoys being evil whereas Ahab has surrendered his will to he appetite and passion for revenge. What wraps my attention is the question why.Second, the craft. Melville is a master storyteller. We see things through Ishmael's eyes, so we feel the distance between Ahab and us. We are detached from the goings on in the story as Ishmael comments on Ahab's journey downward. It must be read to be understood.Third, the milieu. Melville certainly did his homework in researching this novel. Indeed, chapter one seems like a brainstorm on all things whale, and he manages to sustain this encyclopedic knowledge throughout the story. Compare this to Jack London and The Sea-Wolf: London has as much technical knowledge, or more so than Melville, but the Sea-Wolf focuses on the characters Humphrey Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen and the idea of a Neitzchean Superman. Moby-Dick, however, is a study of the whaling milieu and the smudge pot Ahab. London skimps on the description of seal hunting &quot;culture,&quot; and the nuts and bolts of sailing while Melville revels in telling us everything about whaling. This exposition is what kills the book because the plot grinds to a standstill as Melville throws cetological tidbits and tales at us. It is fun to read, but the plot momentum stops dead. It is almost like seeing an infomercial in the middle of the book! Luckily we can skip ahead, unlike reality where we cannot fast-forward commercial.This book is part of a trio that deals with evil captains, the other books being Jack London's &quot;Sea-Wolf,&quot; and Jules Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nemo is just as driven as Ahab, but is more mysterious. We understand Ahab's revenge, since we have all tried to chase down people who have hurt us, or wanted to get back at a barking dog, or barking spouse. That is the appeal-we relate to Ahab better than Nemo, who is cerebral, cold, distant and obscure.Wolf Larsen is another matter. He belongs in the Villain's Hall of Fame, or is it the Rogue's Gallery? Pure evil, a pure manifestation of &quot;intelligence . . . added to brute power and evil will&quot; (Inferno, 31) that was never matched or equaled until Thomas Harris created Hannibal Lecter. Ahab is obsessed and we understand why someone wants revenge, but Larsen is terrifying in that he enjoys being evil. I just wish that Larsen would get more exposure.So in a knot, I recommend this book, but advise people to feel free in skipping over the unnecessary chapter, or buying an abridged version. Read &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; and &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; to nail down the image of an evil captain.FOR ANYONE WRITING A REPORT: This story is a tale of &quot;Man Versus Nature&quot; embodied by the whale. Read Genesis 16-17,21, 25, 28 and 1 Kings 16, 18, 20-22 for Ishmael and Ahab. Aren't I kind!"

I was a massive fan of the older Bond movies when I was young (but not so much the newer ones, after Bond's character became diluted in political correctness). I also love gambling, so I was thrilled to find out how detailed this book got about the intricacies of the casino games. Baccarat has always confused the crap out of me, but now, thanks to Fleming's description, through Bond, I have a fairly good idea how to play it, and would love to try it sometime!In the beginning, Bond is a complete misogynist, and a bit of a racist. I'm no expert, but it's shocking how little he understands women and how their minds work! Then again, I guess that was probably true of most men, back in the '50s, when the book was written.The mission is to out-gamble a powerful and desperate adversary named Le Chiffre. Bond of course pulls it off, and I don't think there's any spoiler in me saying that. The mission, though, is simply a prelude to the love affair between Bond and the female spy whom he worked with. I thought that that story was far more detailed than it would've been in the movie (I haven't seen the movie), taking up 20% of the book. I found it thoroughly satisfying. We get to see Bond's sensitive and philosophical side grow, even start to feel a little sorry for him. I particularly enjoyed his philosophical meanderings on the nature of good and evil.For the most part, though, I found the plot to be somewhat predictable. I think that that's probably because the story is so old now, and elements of it have been borrowed so many times over the years, for so many different spy stories and thrillers. Perhaps if I'd read it in the '50s, it would've garnered a five star review from me!One thing I can say is that the ending was a complete surprise for me, and made it all worthwhile!

B0006D6YSS,Theology and Sanity,,AGYBBD0FUOQR6,"John Benintendi ""J.K. Benintendi""",4/4,5.0,1210723200,Wonderful Overview in Plain English,"This was a wonderful book; one that I needed to read given my questions concerning God and His role in our lives. I also needed to read this book to determine how it is that the Church continues to spread the word of God given that the Church is organized and run by man. Man, inherently, because of the fall of Adam, is prone to sin. So how is it that the Church, run by man, who is prone to sin, can be the one organization to espouse the ""truth"" of God and His Son, Jesus?The first aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was that Father Sheed takes some very complicated topics and puts them into plain English so that the lay person can understand them. Father Sheed's explanation of the trinity, one of the most complicated aspects of the Catholic Religion (in my opinion), was explained in a most wonderful way. It was explained so that I could understand it and without all the ""religious"" terminology that usually accompanies such explanations.The second aspect of the book that I enjoyed was the organization. He takes these issues from step one and then logically continues with the book up to the end. He takes the prior steps and incorporates them into later steps and wonderfully demonstrates how they all fit together.The third aspect of this book I loved was the explanation of why Jesus ""lowered"" himself to human form. Father Sheed had a wonderful way of explaining why is it was that Jesus came to do what he did. He ties this in with the fall of Adam and how the fall of Adam severed our relationship with God. Father Sheed also explains what ""original sin"" is and why we have it. It is not that the person born has sinned but has the sin of Adam just because we are human. Because of the fall, man was severed with God but Jesus came to ""bridge"" that gap and that is what he did.Do not get the idea that the ""sanity"" part of the book title means that if you don't live the Catholic Way perfectly that one is insane. This is not what that term means in the context of the book. Sanity means seeing the world as it really is; not deceiving ourselves that the world is differnt that it really is. If we can do that, then we are seeing things correctly and have ""sanity"". However, not seeing the world and God as they truly are does not mean you are insane, in the mental aspect of the word. Father Sheed gives us a good idea what it means to not see things as they really are and how to change that in our lives.This is a wonderful book. However, this did take me a long time to read. Father Sheed has much to say and it is all something that you must think about to fully understand what he is saying. You cannot read this book like a fiction novel; you can't or you will miss much of what Fr. Sheed is saying. It will take time but the time is well worth it.I have already purchased two more of Fr. Sheed's books and I look forward to reading them.If you have an interest in learning more about the Catholic, or even just the Christian faith in plain English, then I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It certainly has helped me along in my own search on God and the role He plays in our lives.Enjoy!"

It was wonderful.....,"last week, a winter storm brought down power lines in my neighborhood and plunged me into a blackout for five days. luckily, i had my first edition of BLUE SHOE to tide me over until the power went back on. it was crucial to my well being, and for that I thank Ms. Lamott.BLUE SHOE offers Lamott's trademark array of real-life characters that endear one to them in much the same way that Anne Tyler's do; we relate to these people because they are not shiny and happy lobotomized versions of human beings -- deeply flawed, they struggle to the surface of their lives as we root them on, never quite knowing what will happen next. No cookie-cutter relationships here, thank GOD. although I am not religious, I didn't feel alienated by the christianity references -- this is hardly OLD TESTAMENT stuff, just a gentle sea current of spirituality that threads its way through the text. my favorite passages seemed to squeeze time sideways, protracting the moments in the character's lives that plot is made of. of particular sensitivity and beauty is Lamott's portrayal of Abby, and the tenuous relationship with her dead father which resolves itself by the end of the novel in a way that can be understood and believed in. All in al,l I got the same feeling of well being and good company that each of Lamotts novels have stirred in me. the fact that she makes it look easy does not mean that it IS easy to write about complex moral dillemmas and family secrets with such style and grace. I found the final pages of the book to be glorious and I was saddened to arrive at the last page. Closing the book with a full and round feeling of contentment, I found myself wondering whether, after all the agnostic nonsense and harsh petty criticism leveled at her on this site, Lamott will do us the honor of another novel soon.

B0006AUJ0U,The Quiet American,,A1FM2IPDKI7M2L,Rachel Hajar,1/1,4.0,1284249600,Go Home Young Man,"Set in French colonial Vietnam in the 1950s on the eve of the French overthrow, the book portrays the evolution of a love triangle: a jaded, cynical, opium addict British journalist (Thomas Fowler), the soft-spoken, intellectual, and idealistic quiet American (Alden Pyle), and a young Vietnamese girl (Phoung). Fowler and Phoung are lovers but Pyle steals the girl away from Fowler but winds up dead in the river. Fowler is suspected of the murder. He recalls memories of Pyle, narrating past events involving himself, Pyle, and Phoung. Phoung is highly desired by Fowler even though he takes her for granted whereas Pyle views her as a delicate flower to be protected. But the character of Phoung is weakly developed in the book and she comes around as an opportunist.Running parallel to the plot are political themes: communism, colonianism, and American foreign policies in the region. The novel touches on the horrors of war in a third world country: the class distinctions of colonianism, opium addiction, brothels, death, and destruction.It is clear throughout the book that Fowler dislikes Pyle and makes sweeping statements like, ""The only quiet American is a dead American."" There are numerous instances where Fowler makes disparaging statements about Americans in a third world country so that the novel became widely known for its anti-American sentiment.The book is good and skillfully written, as befits a work by a famous author like Greene. I highly recommend this book."
B00088GJAO,Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam,,,,2/3,5.0,973728000,A Sublime Meditation On The Human Predicament,"This beautifully illustrated edition of Omar Khayyam's classic poem is a gem. The illustrations complement the lyrical imagery of the poem. Two editions of Fitzgerald's translation are included, with the second including additional quatrains, and representing a mature and slightly darker reading of the poem. The introduction contains a lot of interesting information, but don't be misled. Far from being a work of skepticism, this beautiful poem reflects deep-thinking belief."

Catherine the daughter was a confused character, sometimes I think along with other readers......that Emily wrote this to compete with her sisterm b/c she didn't feel loved enough and had probelms of her own that she could onlt deal with by writing a book that basically describes her life and what happened in her life from Childhood to her adulthood.

0971038007,Gold Wars: The Battle Against Sound Money As Seen From A Swiss Perspective,19.95,,,55/94,1.0,1049673600,Poorly written incoherent rambling,"The book is so poorly written and rambles so much it is difficult to know where to start. Ok, how about this: I basically agreed with the author in that it would be better for the majority of the population to have a sound currency, such as gold. I hated the book anyway.The author is a gold nut, who, between various diatribes about how great gold is and how terrible fiat money is, quotes other gold nuts at length about how great gold is and how terrible fiat money is. Probably at least 20% of the book is block quotes. I'm serious. Which would be fine if the quotes contained a lot of important information, but for the most part they don't.The intended audience of the book could only be other gold nuts. It reads almost like the author is talking to himself. Several times when the author mentioned important historical events or economic terms, I felt compelled to look them up to try to understand the context of what he was saying. Eventually, it got too frustrating.As a final indignity, the author goes on to say &quot;At the beginning of the 1970s, wage and price inflation soared, leading to lofty energy prices and vice versa ... had America maintained a stable dollar, there never would have been an OPEC problem.&quot; (pg 95)Like a typical economist, Lips has everything backwards. The economy doesn't run on money, it runs on ENERGY. The oil shocks wrecked the economy and spiked inflation because without energy, you can't do anything. If you live on a world with no oil but lots of gold, it doesn't matter how much gold you have, your car will never run. Because economists don't understand this, they write 200 page books about what kind of money we use while totally ignoring what massive corporations are doing to our natural resources and the environment.The book's point is: we should be on the gold standard. Buy gold and protect yourself. I agree. I do not recommend buying the book however."
B000JSMA1U,THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.,,AN9TLUKFAJHP8,Tung Yin,5/5,5.0,957657600,Classic adventure story about an ocean hijacking,"Alistair MacLean was one of the best adventure writers of all time. He does it all on the strength of plot; style and characterization are nearly non-existent, but they aren't the reason you read MacLean books. I dare say that virtually every major adventure plot is covered in one of his novels, and his influence is such that subsequent authors have paid homage to scenes of his. (For example, there's a scene in Clive Cussler's &quot;The Mediterranean Caper&quot; that's a virtual reprise of a scene from &quot;The Secret Ways.&quot;)&quot;The Golden Rendezvous&quot; is a classic ocean hijacking story, where the hero is the ship's First Officer (John Carter). The ship is a converted ocean liner, full of guests, some mysterious, and carrying some secret cargo. During the cruise, the ship gets hijacked by some violent but devious criminals. Some of the ship's officers are killed, and others, including Carter, are wounded. Still, Carter attempts to stop the hijackers. . . .This is one of the best MacLean novels, written in the 1960s along with a stellar run that includes &quot;The Satan Bug,&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare,&quot; &quot;Puppet on a Chain,&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Navarone.&quot; Most of those were turned into movies, and in the 1970s, Hollywood adapted &quot;The Golden Rendezvous&quot; into a so-so Richard Harris movie titled &quot;Nuclear Terror.&quot;"

I don't know what it is about Shirley Jackson's mastery of horror, but I wish I had it. Beautifully written and absorbing. No supernatural powers in this... Merricat's mind and the events occurring are quite terrifying enough. Constance is the perfect mother character, good-natured and willing to humor her sister and keep Merricat out of harm's way at all cost. Charles was an incredibly believable antagonist, behaving as just about anyone would, had they a motive and were they put into what was apparently a madhouse. Incredible."

The first few pages enthralled me with Kingsolver's beautiful prose. There is much humor in the different versions of events by the 3 daughters. The narrative structure, with each chapter narrated by one of the characters, reminds me of Faulkner's masterpiece, As I Lay Dying. Each daughter has a different reaction to the same experience & makes a different choice of how to live. One escapes to a life of comfort in South Africa. Another marries an African & works to help these oppressed people. I learned much about the Congo & how Belgium & our government exploited it. I learned a main reason why there are so many dictators & so much corruption in African countries & other countries: dictators & corrupt leaders are more useful to the U. S., other powerful nations, & multinational corporations because they can be bribed to serve foreign interests, instead of the interests of their people. I decided that I wanted my own copy of this work of art, so I bought one on amazon.com."

I liked it because of its thorough kind of description. Very complete! Besides, it wasn't anything scary. It has a couple places of romance. But it has a good deal of fighting. This story is based during the Civil War. I soldier named Buck who falls in love with a girl named Jenny. The problem is that Buck was a Northern soldier and that Jenny was a Southern spy. When they both got to know each other they fell in love. Their love was so great that the two were almost inseperable. But, Jenny's father won't hear of her daughter getting married to Buck. For one thing he was a Northerner for the other, his social status was not high. Why Jenny is a spy is because her father works as the president's kinda mission worker. But Mr. Lincoln doesn't know that the father is a spy. So, the story is in kind of a suspense. I really recomend this book to those people that are obsessed with Civil War, adventure, fighting and romance."

The book seems like a great study in 3rd person limited and hits on every kind of emotional high and low a man who is alone would probably experience. The fights scenes between him and the vampires were absolutely awesome and it felt like I was right there along with Robert Neville (the protagonist) kneeing a vampire in the face, hitting them with his car as he scurried back to the house, or shooting them in the face. Matheson has a great use of realism and while the book has some really cliche events (that I won't go into here), they still all work. In the end, you're sort of floored from the powerful combination of good writing and imagination. If you want a book that pretty much haunts you even after you have read it, then check this book out. It's worth it. And oldie but goodie that delivers."

Well now this year I approached high school, during my off periods I wander off into the FHS library~my sanctuary. I looked through the new book section and found scribbler of dreams again. Sitting in a comfy chair my mind sank into this book. This book allowed me to enter the world of Kaitlin who has this burden of her father being a murderer, which is really depressing. Going to a new high school in your senior year is challenging..really difficult since it's the last year. Reading about the love that Bram and Kaitlin shared I thought was very touching, it's not the hots or puppy love..it's true love. reading this book I acutally cried because a love Kaitlin/Bram could have maybe threatened by her past and the passion they both have is simply beautiful.'life is beautiful'.

Many financial &quot;gurus&quot; have taunted people with the vision of financial freedom and eternal happiness for years. They are not honest about the fact that by the time you have the &quot;riches&quot; you have so painstakingly saved for, you are physically, emotionally and mentally spent. Both the husband and wife look physically repulsive, you are sick to death of each other after years of psychological game playing and have no emotional strength left to &quot;enjoy&quot; basically anything. I think it's important to realize that every relationship is a gamble and no human is perfect. Beauty fades as the body grows old and our hearts become torn by the torrents and storms of marriage and life events. Family members from both sides pry and fight over any money you have and impose guilt trips on you for any success - considering only a small percentage of people actually acheive this type of wealth before getting a terminal illness or dying tragically. It is much wiser to build a life on the wealth and richness of good friends and great experiences and not roll your dice for a perfect &quot;someday.&quot; My advice would be to save your money, which is basic common sense, and not buy this book. Use the money now, in your life, for something that will make you truly happy."

Instead we get to hear all about the many &quot;oh so wonderful&quot; people who came into her life. She spends one or two paragraphs on these countless friends and never mentions them again. Of course, we are privileged to know how these people are famous as well as hearing about her many manservants. Her tales are sad but told with complete and unbelievable surrealism. Her marriage is not just a good marriage, it's a &quot;supernatural marriage&quot;. Her daughter is not Sveva, she is the recreation of Paolo.

It was worth it. The book is an excellent reference for anyone interested in (or morbidly fascinated by) suicide. It is a scholarly work which has been meticulously researched. Mr. Stone has added immense value to the store of knowledge about what can be a difficult and emotive subject. The accusations that are thrown around that he has done ""something immoral"" by clearly setting out how people can chose and execute (pun intended) a suicide method are just plain nonsense. Yes, he may indeed have assisted some people to make the final exit in a way that suits them, but because he also gives equal weight to the means by which people in pain can make a ""call for help"" through attempted suicide in an effective and safe manner suggests to me that he may well indeed have saved lives. The book can be a little dry in terms of statistics, but the chapter notes are often wickedly funny. All in all an excellent book."

Also how if a violent crime occurs and the victim is black and the perpetrator white it often becomes a a national hysteria, whereas black on white crimes, which are staggeringly more common are buried if not out and out intentionally covered up. He points out all the typical things that these respectable quasi racists talk about, affirmative action, unfair hiring practices, academic/leftist hypocrisy, etc.Here's where I have a problem with Taylor. He, as is typical of right wingers, both racial, and non racial, big on whining about welfare and social programs. Well I live in a Scandinavian country that puts a lot of money into social programs and I've seen firsthand how they benefit a society if you have a society where the majority isn't complete scum. The biggest thing though is Taylor is completely detached from working class white people. He is Yale educated and grew up going to private schools in Japan and I believe France also. He is totally out of touch with how life is for poor, working and middle class whites. He is more or less trying to sell himself off to upper class whites and conservative Jews. There is no criticism of capitalism in this book and of course he doesn't dare say the ""J"" word or claim that what is going on is intentional social engineering from the highest levels of society. Its all the just misguided leftists setting government policies and caving in to system controlled black rabblerousers like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton that are the problem in his world. If your not a stiff right winger I would recomend Jim Goads Redneck Manifesto way before anything written by the Jared Taylors or Pat Buchanans of the world."

However, there are some notable errors in the book and strong statements that deserve quite obvious and important caveats. There is no discussion of the importance of effective porosity. Using the wrong porosity value is a common error used to bias analyses of contaminant transport velocity. There are errors such as stating that organic carbon is associated with clay content, which is completely wrong in many parts of the country where clay residuum dominates. Clay minerals have no carbon content themselves, but may be associated with organic materials in alluvial settings. There are many such problems with this book and I am hesitant to offer it to those learning the practice because of all the corrections I'd need to make."

It is the definitework in that it portrays Nicholas not only as Tsar ofall the Russias , but as the father, the husband, andthe family man.All these aspects are crucial if we areto understand the man himself and the steps he tookto command his great empire. It is an extremely fairwork, showing the Tsar's shortcomings as a ruler, but yetat the same time his humaness, his vulnerability fromhis own position.Massie has excelled himself with this book, and I highlyrecommend it to any reader seeking an introduction tothis most fascinating period of Russian history.There have been criticisms of this book stating that Nicholasand his reign should have been studied in the context of say, other rulers of the time. This is a granted point, but one I feelMassie achieves in his commentary of the world spectrum on thewhole particularly in the years 1905 through to the first WorldWar.To isolate the &quot;family man&quot; from the ruler is impossible -they were part of each other.So congratulations to Robert Massie, this book is a verygreat achievement!"

1593351348,Wuthering Heights,18.96,A13EJ2WVGPO3G3,Jojo,0/0,4.0,1290124800,An Unforgettable Tale of the Trials of Love,"A young girl by the name of Emily Bronte delivered the world a story. Although 'love' is contained in all aspects of this book, this is not a love story. Wuthering Neights is the tragic and heartbreaking story of two lovers destroyed, and the outcomes that follow.From beginning to end, this novel was a page-turner for me. I simply did not want to put it down, and at times, I couldn't. We begin our story with Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant in the manor of Thrushcross Grange. Throughout the story, he writes in his diary, documenting the life of the inhabitants of Thrushcross Grange. Though Wuthering Heights is told through the viewpoint of more than one person, everything is documented by Mr. Lockwood himself. The setting is in England, 1801. If you are a fan of the Bronte sister's or tragic British literature, then this is the story for you! We have our resident of Wuthering Heights: grumpy Mr. Heathcliff, the landlord. The state of the manor is unacceptable to our newcomer, but he leaves determined to make a better impression than his first. His sights of the manor are atrocious as he describes it on page 9 as, ""the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment, 'Go the to Deuce', even the gate over which leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words."" As rude as the atmosphere was, he returns for more, to write a story.On our new day, we meet Joseph, our very own illiterate and unhappy servant. Following, we meet the beautiful but pale young man, Catherine Linton and a young man by the name of Hareton Earnshaw. The names confuse Lockwood and he recognizes the tension and mystery within this 'family'. After a strange and frightening encounter that you will read about, he retreats to his home.Meeting up with his servants, we are introduced to Nelly, who has great ties with the residents of Thrushcross Grange. The story unfolds into a mess of tragic love, as we are whisked away to 20 years in the past, as told by Nelly. She was a servant to the Earnshaw family, whom we meet early on. There is Catherine, Hindley, Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw. One day, after returning from a long trip, Mr. Earnshaw brings back a boy rather than a souvenir. His name is Heathcliff and he is a gipsy boy from the streets of England who comes into their family, and leaves them changed forever. There is tension within this household, but only towards the two young boys who you will read about. Heathcliff and Catherine hit it off early and are the best of friends. However, society would have things different.As I mentioned before, this is not a love story. As we progress, we find this to be more of tragedy, failed love and revenge. So much evil doings and rebellion unfolds as you read on, that it will make your heart burst! Every harsh and cruel decision made through rude intentions causes you to be ripped apart, but it gets better! I cannot even put to words the way that Wuthering Heights will mess with your emotions, but it is definitely worth it! Catherine and Heathcliff find love, but the standards of the world would prove to be stronger than they could handle at such a young age. The bond they would create is soon left to wither away and haunt them forever. The legacy they leave is known by all. I encourage all readers to not underestimate the tragedy of these pages. It is gripping, heart-wrenching and unforgettable. It has personally moved me and I could not ask for more!"

In this book they said very disgusting and horrible things about Muslims (1.5 Billion people in total.) Considering that they were a part of the United States Government and is close to George Bush we can deduce that the U.S government's believes are echoed in their opinions.Mr. frum and Perle said that Iraq is on its way to becoming a blossoming democracy; white lies, if that was the case then the U.S would hold free and fare elections in Iraq (which is what the Iraqis want overwhelmingly) and risk the election of a Shia government which is anti-U.S. But of course, U.S would not do that. Examples of governments (&quot;democratic&quot; in American eyes) that have been supposedly democratic and supported by the U.S are numerous; Zaire, Afghanistan, Egypt, Pinochet's Chile etc. The U.S would only do what is good for her, not for the greater good of the world.Mr. Frum and Perle, the United States also wants to become the greatest nation in the world, don't blame France for anything.

B000NGRMTS,A Clockwork Orange,,A1DK6JLU5CGYM0,"adri ""adri""",1/3,3.0,1135296000,kiilller review.,"A CLOCKWORK ORANGEIn Anthony Burgess's, A Clockwork Orange, his depiction of the future teenage culture is a disturbing one. It is a compelling story about the importance of free thinking. The main character, Alex a fifteen year old boy leads a group of three other ""droogs,"" Pete, Georgie, and poor old Dim. The four boys antagonize citizens for amusement, roaming the streets, engaging in gang violence, robbery, beating up men, and raping women. Justice seemed like a thing of the past until one night it caught up with Alex when he and his droogs stole a car and cruised the streets looking for trouble wherever they could find it. The others, were inspired to turn their backs to their leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman's house, and she calls the police as the boys are trying to flee the scene Dim hits Alex in the face was deserted and left for the police. The police then inform Alex that the women he beat and raped in an earlier robbery has passed. Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison for her death. After fighting with and killing his cellmate he is chosen for an experimental treatment called Ludovico's Technique. The doctors inject him with a drug that makes him experience nausea and headaches, while making him watch violent movies and listen to classical music. After two weeks of this brainwashing torment the mere thought of violence is enough to make Alex ill and is released from prison. A twisted hand of fate leads him to a cottage for help, and he recognizes the man whose wife he had raped. After talking with Alex he begins to recognize the slang nadsat, that the teenagers who broke into his house and raped his wife used, which arouses his suspicion. He changes, his mind and locks Alex in an apartment and blare classical music, hoping to drive him to his suicide. He throws himself out the window, but only to wake up at a hospital, shortly after the old violent Alex is restored. The only thing that defines individuality is our differences, whether they be good or bad ones, it's wrong to try to correct people's faults. Humans are far from perfect, and brainwashing them to fit the mold, stripping them of their individuality is sinful. The book is narrated in teen slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of Cockney English and Russian. I would suggest that you search for a glossary online in order to develop a better understand of the text. I would highly recommend reading this book, because it offers insight into the mind of a violent thinker."

Howard lightly seasoned with a handful of illustrations, its bang for the buck factor is pretty high.""Nine Cautionary Tales of the Risen and Hungry Dead - Told in Words and Pictures; including famously Dead Author and Patriarch of Terrifying Adventure, Robert E. Howard."" It's rare that a book's promotional blurb is worth referring to, but in this case it's appropriate thanks to its nailing of the anthology's overall tone: wry and a tad old school, perhaps the kind of thing Max Gaines would be publishing if the Comics Code Authority hadn't castrated his line of horror comics so many years ago. From the clever twist of Kelley Jones' ""The Hungry Ghosts"" opener, to the waterlogged horror of Jamie S. Rich and Guy Davis' ""Kago No Tori,"" Book of the Dead delivers literate storytelling that doesn't shortchange fans of gore and hanging entrails. Pat McEown's ""Queen of Darkness"" is the most intriguing entry, hinting at a much larger story that begs for a more elaborate telling, possibly hinted at in the credits which explain this story ""marks his return to comics as both writer and artist.""David Crouse and Todd Herman offer up the disturbing ""The Ditch;"" Eric Powell's ""The Wallace Expedition"" is a creepy tale with a nice Classics Illustrated-style execution; and Book of the Dead editor Scott Allie himself teams up with Paul Lee and Brian Horton for the surprisingly melancholy ""The Magicians."" Allie arguably saves the best for last, though, closing out with Evan Dorkin and Jill Thompson's ""Let Sleeping Dogs Lie,"" sort of Stephen King's Pet Sematary told from the perspective of the pets themselves. Fans of Grant Morrison's overrated WE3 should check this one out to see a twist on a familiar theme done right.While there are no outright misses here, there are a couple of questionable entries that keep this worthy project from A+ status. Mike Mignola's ""The Ghoul"" strikes a dubious balance between pretension and confusion as the BPRD track down a ghoulish fellow who only speaks in poetry while Hellboy beats the stuffing out of him, as annoyed by the stylistic quirk as I was. Perhaps some more familiarity with Hellboy would have improved my opinion of the piece, but if so, in this context, it would still be considered a swing and a miss. The other strike is Bob Fingerman and Roger Langridge's ""Death Boy,"" a cartoony humor piece that brings to mind the old Sesame Street ""one of these things is not like the others"" segments. It's not bad, per se, just completely jarring in its tone and a bad fit here.Nevertheless, the whole is far greater than the sum of its unequal parts, and it's an enjoyable collection worth every penny, suitable not just for genre fans but any fan of good writing and artwork. It's also a perfect introduction to comics for anyone that thinks they're just for kids and/or all about superheroes."

Jim redeems himself in a remote jungle village somewhere in Indonesia, where he is called Lord Jim by the locals.Joseph Conrad, who was Polish but lived in Britain, wrote with a flourishing style that was entirely British -- long complex sentences that both captivate the imagination and require attention to detail.

His elder brother, Darry, brings him up after the death of his parents in a car accident. Though Pony resents him, he is also in awe of him. He also idolizes his middle brother, Soda. All three brothers belong to a gang of poor teenagers called the Greasers, named for their long, oily hair. Their bitter rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town. Pony is involved in the murder of a Soc named Bob. After the killing, he runs away with his friend Johnny to Windrixville. There they hide in an abandoned church. When the church catches on fire, they bravely rescue some children trapped in it. Johnny is badly injured and has to be hospitalized. When he dies, Pony is completely shattered. He cannot reconcile himself to his friend's death until he reads a letter Johnny has left for him telling him to 'stay gold' and to continue appreciating sunsets. He finally understands that with hard work he can overcome his circumstances and not remain an outsider all his life. Pony then adopts a mission for himself to tell the rest of the world about the odds that under-privileged children have to face. He also realizes and appreciates how much Darry loves and cares for him.Johnny Cade - a member of the Greasers whom the other gang members try to protect. His father constantly beats him up, and his mother either ignores his presence or screams at him. He becomes a nervous wreck after he is terribly beaten up by the Socs. He starts carrying a switchblade in his pocket; when he and Pony are attacked by the Socs, he uses the knife to kill Bob in self-defense. He hides with Pony in an abandoned church in Windrixville and heroically rescues children who are trapped in the church after it catches fire. During the rescue, a burning beam falls on his back, and he later dies in a hospital. Before dying, he tells Dally that 'fighting's no good' and asks Pony to 'stay gold.' Even after death, his spirit reaches out to Pony in the form of a letter which he leaves for him, exhorting him to remain pure and rise above being an outsider. The letter motivates Pony to tell the rest of the world that it is wrong to judge children by the amount of hair oil they wear.Dallas Winston (Dally) - the toughest, coldest, and meanest of the Greasers. He has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. He gives Pony and Johnny a gun and some money when they come to him after Bob's death. He also tells them where to hide. During the rescue, Dally plunges into the burning church to rescue Johnny, who is trapped under a beam. Upset by Johnny's death, he threatens the police with an unloaded gun after robbing a store. He dies without the world knowing about his qualities or the reasons for his delinquency.SETTINGThe Outsiders is set in a large, unnamed town in the United States. It is about a gang of teenage boys who are called the Greasers. They live on the east side of the town, also known as the wrong side of town; the eastside neighborhood is described in graphic detail. The story is set in the 1960's and relates the incidents that take place over a few days. After killing Bob, Pony and Johnny take shelter in an abandoned church in Windrixville. After it catches fire and burns down, they return to their hometown, where Johnny dies in a hospital.CONFLICTProtagonistPony Curtis is the teenage narrator and protagonist of the novel. When his parents were killed in a car accident, Darry, his twenty- year-old brother, began to provide for him. He resents Darry's bullying manner, not realizing that he does so because he loves him and wants him to make something of himself. Pony belongs to an eastside gang of poor teenagers, called the Greasers; their rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town.AntagonistPony's antagonist is his status in life. Poor and from the wrong side of town, he gets no breaks in life, even though he is a good student and studies hard. He joins the Greasers because it is the thing to do if you live on the east side of town. Their rivals are the Socs, a gang of rich, spoiled kids living on the west side of town. The Socs constantly pick fights with the Greasers, and Bob, one of the Socs, attacks Johnny and Pony because they have been friendly with Cherry. Johnny kills Bob in self-defense, and he and Pony go into hiding in a church in Windrixville. When the church catches on fire, Johnny and Pony try to save the children trapped inside. Johnny is serious injured during the rescue and dies a few days later in a hospital. Dally, who was Johnny's best friend, is completely shattered by his death. Crazy with grief, he robs a store and then threatens the police with an unloaded gun. As a result, he is killed. Now Pony has lost two friends. He falls sick, becomes delirious, tries to deny Johnny's death, and begins to fail in school.ClimaxThe climax occurs when Pony reads the letter that Johnny has written to him before his death. Johnny encourages his friend to ""stay gold"" - to look for the sunsets and good things in life. He tells Pony that if he tries, he will be able to make something worthwhile out of his life. Reading the letter is the turning point in Pony's life.OutcomeThe novel ends as a tragic comedy. Even though Bob, Johnny, and Dally have needlessly perished, Pony overcomes his problems, largely due to Johnny's letter of encouragement. He reconciles with Darry, finally understanding how much his older brother loves and cares for him. He also accepts that he does not have to be an outsider or a Greaser for the rest of his life. In order to seek help and understanding for underprivileged children like himself, Pony's mission becomes to tell others about the immense obstacles that stand in the way of success for teenagers from the wrong side of town. The novel, therefore, ends on a note of hope and optimism.PLOTPony Curtis is a member of the Greasers, a gang of poor teenagers with long, oily hair and from the wrong side of town. While returning home from the movies one night, Pony is attacked by the Socs, a gang of rich kids from the west side of town. Pony is afraid that they are going to kill him and starts shouting for help. His brothers (Darry and Soda), along with Steve Randle, Two Bit Matthews, Dally Winston, and Johnny Cade, rush to his rescue. After ascertaining that Pony is relatively unharmed, Darry shouts at him for walking alone and tells him that he should use a bit of common sense. Darry is Pony's oldest brother who has provided for him since his parents were killed in a car accident. Darry knows that Pony is smart and wants him to do well in life. As a result, he constantly nags Pony about doing well in school and making good grades. Pony resents his brother's intrusion in his life and his unemotional ways. In contrast, Pony adores Soda, his middle brother. He is a high school dropout, who works at a gas station with his best friend Steve Randal. Two-Bit Matthews is a member of the Greasers who always tries to have the last word on things. Johnny Cade is another gang member whom everyone tries to protect, because his father constantly tries to beat him up. The toughest character of the Greaser's gang is Dally, who has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. Pony, Johnny, and Dally decide to go to the drive-in the next evening. There they meet Cherry and Marcia, friends of the Socs. Dally is rude and obnoxious. When Cherry throws a coke in his face, he stalks off in anger. Pony and Johnny are left to watch the movie with the girls, but they are soon joined by Two Bits. After the movie they decide to walk to Two Bits' house to pick up his car in order to take the girls home. Along the way, Pony and Cherry find that they have a lot in common; they are both are idealistic dreamers, who love sunsets. Suddenly a blue Mustang pulls up near them. Two members of the Socs, Bob and Randy, emerge from the car to confront them. A fight almost takes place between the boys, but Cherry prevents it by getting into the Mustang.Two-Bit goes off to play snooker, and Pony and Johnny go to the vacant lot where they often hang out. At about two-thirty in the morning, Pony gets up with a start, for he has fallen asleep in the vacant lot. He rushes home to find Darry awake and frantic with worry. He shouts at Pony, which results in an argument. When Darry slaps his younger brother, Pony rushes out of the house and finds Johnny. As they walk in the park, Bob, Randy, and several other Socs attack them for being with their girls earlier. In the fight that follows, Johnny, in self-defense, kills Bob with his switchblade.In a panic, Johnny and Pony go to Dally for help. He gives them a loaded gun, money, and directions to reach an abandoned church in Windrixville, where they can hide out. They change their appearance by cutting off their long hair and pass the time by reading Gone with the Wind and discussing life. Once Pony recites one of Robert Frost's poems, ""Nothing Gold Can Stay."" Johnny understands that ""gold"" in the poem stands for freshness, innocence, and purity.On the fifth day of their hiding, Dally comes to visit Pony and Johnny. He takes them out to eat and informs them that the tension between the Socs and the Greasers has increased. A rumble between the two gangs is supposedly to take place the following evening. Dally says that he has started carrying an unloaded gun to serve as a deterrent to any serious trouble. Johnny announces his decision to turn himself in to the police, for he does not want to be on the run for the rest of his life. He believes that he will get a light sentence since he has killed Bob in self-defense. Dally tries to dissuade him; he knows first-hand that any prison time is miserable.THEMESMajorThe major theme of the novel revolves around the purposelessness of any gang of teenagers. The book centers on the foolish gang rivalry existing between the Socs, the rich kids from the west side of town, and the Greasers, the poor kids from the east side.Pony, the protagonist of the story, is bitter about the fact that the wealthy Socs have nice cars, fancy clothes, and girlfriends; things are simply easier for them than for the Greasers. Because the Socs are convinced that they are better, they constantly pick on members of the Greasers, who fight back. During one squabble, Bob, one of the Socs, is murdered by Johnny in self-defense. Then Johnny, while hiding out in a church, is killed while trying to rescue children from the burning building. In reaction to Johnny's death, Dally, his best friend, goes on a rampage. He robs a store and points an unloaded gun at the police; as a result, he is shot and killed. Because of the needless gang fighting, three teenagers are killed in the novel, clearly pointing out the negative aspect of belonging to a gang. Hinton is obviously trying to warn the reader against participation in any gang.MinorRelated to the major theme of the book is the theme that a teenager can rise above his circumstances through hard work, patience, and determination. Pony is the proof of this theme. Even though he is born into poverty, loses his parents in a car accident at an early age, and participates in the Greasers, by the end of the book, he is determined to better his plight in life, largely due to the encouragement he receives from the deceased Johnny in a letter. At the close of the novel, Pony wants to tell the world that underprivileged children need to have some breaks in order to get ahead and need to be judged for who they are, not by how they look or how they dress. Hinton definitely convinces the reader that Pony, because of his intelligence and determination, will rise above the poverty and gang life that he was born into.MOODWhen the story opens, the mood is bitter and rebellious. Pony and the other Greasers resent the fact that the Socs have lots of money, nice cars, fancy clothes, and many girlfriends. In contrast, they are poor and must work extremely hard for everything they have. In addition, society is prejudiced against them because of their clothes, long hair, and greasy appearance. In the middle of the novel, the mood becomes increasingly angry. The Greasers are tired of the Socs always picking on them, and the Socs are furious about the Greasers hanging out with some of ""their girls."" As a result, the Socs jump Pony and Johnny. In self-defense Johnny kills Bob, one of the Socs. The mood then becomes one of terror. Pony and Johnny are scared for their own safety and fear the police. Upon Dally's advice, they hide in an abandoned church and worry about being found. The mood then switches to great sadness, for Johnny, in trying to rescue the children when the church catches on fire, is killed himself. Dally then gets himself foolishly shot by the police, leaving Pony with two less friends. By the end of the novel, however, the mood has some degree of hope. Pony is determined to rise above his past. He adopts a new mission in life, to tell the world about the problems and deprivations of underprivileged children, like himself. It is obvious that in the end, Hinton is very sympathetic towards the plight of Pony and the Greasers."

I'd read it before, but it had been more than 20 years. An adventure story, it also deals (usually obliquely) with a lot of social, moral, and cultural issues, including (most obviously) issues of race. Twain's use of the ""N"" word is startling and disturbing to modern ears, but it is essential to convey the import.I remember that when I first read it, I didn't like the last few chapters very much...and I still don't. Quite unlike the first 2/3s of the book, they seem to me to be a cop-out on Twain's part. It's as though - having written a brilliant, sometimes-humorous, often-tragic commentary on life - he felt the need to dumb-it-down at the end."
B000GYBA68,Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth,,A32SNRWECXXEGY,"Paul West ""Pablo""",29/35,4.0,1043452800,"Sadly, it's the truth","Why do the spiritually blind insist on reading books without braille? This book by David Wilkerson takes no prisoners -- and that includes heresy hunters and ""lukewarm"" churchgoers (notice I didn't mention Christians). I believe one must be spirit-filled to fully agree with this book. The mood echoes that of a 20th century Jeremiah or Ezekiel -- and the finger of woe is pointed directly at America.I, for one, believe that America is in great danger. I do not claim to be a doomsday prophet; I take notice of the signs of the time. Yes, you don't have to be a spiritual giant to see that TV is immersed in total trash. The author wrote this book back in 1985, and television was bad enough then. Now, just about everything on the screen is coated with sensual sinfulness and dipped in blasphemy and arrogance. And TV has become an undeniable idol for this nation. Nothing at all glorifies God on the big screen (or the ""Babylonian idiot box"", as the author writes).Popular music and its artists bow down to the whims of society rather than to the Living God. I challenge anyone to dispute the fact that both music and television have slipped even further away from God since the 80's. Things have gotten worse dramatically since Elvis' 1950-ish gyrations -- now the hip-hop artists glamorize cop shootings and drunken orgies. Rock stars perform their shows under the influence of narcotics and intoxicants. The cross meanwhile is tattoed on their arms and worn around their necks. I've recently been to a so-called Christian concert and heard some of the bands that stood for Jesus. Personally, I couldn't tell the difference between Slayer and Pillar. It was all head-banging and moshing. The lead singer grunted and growled and wore ripped-up, grungy jeans. His body was covered with tattoos. If Jesus Christ was being glorified during the all the moshing and stage diving, I must have missed it.I say David Wilkerson is right on the money when he prophesies God will judge this nation for such foolishness and rebellion -- and most of all, for making a mockery of His name. Remember, God will not be mocked. Hosea 4:6 says that God's people will be destroyed for lack of knowledge. Very often I see some supposed ""born-again"" Christian artist get on television and sing for Jesus in a video. But I notice the cherry-red lipstick and seductive eye liner and I see her strike lewd glances at the camera and blow kisses, and I say ""Wait a minute! Isn't this supposed supposed to be all about Jesus? Why then do I need to see all the close-ups on her pretty face and slender physique?"" That, to me, is a stumbling block for young men. All I see is cleavage, muscles and hair gel. Just insert ""God"" in the lyrics or a ""thank-you, Jesus"" and the artist becomes an instant Christian role model for some kid.And as for Russia destroying America...it's not too late. It's never too late for stuff like that to happen. Cold War, Shmold War. All the reviewers here who automatically labeled the author of this book a false prophet when the USSR became the Russian Federation ought not to jump the gun. Ever heard of Gog and Magog? Read the book of Daniel. Remember, nobody knows the day or hour. It could happen tomorrow, or in another 500 years.All in all, Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth is an unpopular warning to all America, a warning of God's condemnation and subsequent punishment for all her harlotries. Like Sodom and Gomorrah, God will obliterate our society (in one hour) by virtue of a Russian nuclear assault (hydrogen holocaust).Take it or leave it. I choose to take it, and cling to holiness. However it happens, we know this world will pass away according to Revelation, and tribulation is unavoidable. If you're washed in the blood of Jesus Christ none of it should matter anyhow. Books like this one, after all, are geared towards the unrepentant sinner and unsaved."

One thing that sets this book up on top of every other fantasy book is the approach that Tolkien takes(or gives)to the Europeian mithology subject carefully and masterfully handled in every page and dialog of the books. Clearly explified is the matter of or suggestion of thuder and lighting...It's a thunder because it's sounds and phonetics are so darn strong that deaf ears to &quot;other&quot; given names before Tolkien, and the lighting is clearly noticed and seen in the sometimes fast and sometimes slow,but shiny, poetry and descriptive action paced narrative beautifully shown troughout the story.

However, just as there is good, enjoyable, challenging popular entertainment (be it in books, TV, pop music, theater or film) there is also subpar popular entertainment that wastes the consumer's time. I also agree whole heartedly with the other reviewers who thought that the plot in this book strains credibility and that the dialog and behavior of Sunny, Spike, Julie, the villainous doctor, etc., are just as difficult to accept. Just as Neil Simon isn't Shakespeare, audiences still have a right to quality entertainment from him. Fans of Parker's Jesse Stone and Spenser expect a certain level of craftsmanship from him, and this time he doesn't deliver."

I felt ripped off by this book's unrealistic, heavyhanded, ABSURD conclusion. The shame is that up until that point the book was extremely well-written, suspenseful, even terrifying. I found at times that I could not read too much in one sitting because of the disturbing psychological depths Harris explores with Lechter. The scenes in Florence were superb, particularly the Santa della Croce encounter between the young woman and Lechter. My other complaint is that Harris woefully and shamefully neglects the Jack Crawford character, though at the beginning you are led to believe he will play a heavier role in this book. Barney has a bigger role which is silly, very unbelievable and frankly unnecessary. More Crawford, less Barney would have been better. As for Clarice Starling, this is NOT the same Clarice from SILENCE. Mr. Harris, how on earth could you lose such insight on her? In conclusion, I urge all readers NOT to purchase this overhyped sequel, unless you enjoy the sensation of having been mugged when you finish it. Note to Hollywood: rewrite the ending, unless you want a bomb on your hands."

The Ultimate Enquiry Mind,"What amazed me about this book was Herodotus'curiosity and lack of ethnocentrisism. Herdotus wasn't simply interested in chronicling major events, but delving deeper to understand why the events occured in the first place. Furthermore, he does something that many scholars and policy makers today should do more of; that is, he trys to understand other cultures in order to make more sence of their actions. In this endeavor, he should not only be called the ""Father of History"", but also the Father of Anthropology. But, perhaps he understood way back then that history and anthropology, as well as geography are all complimentary.While Herodotus - being a Greek himself - undoubtedly sees the Greeks as heroes in their struggle against the Persian invasion, he shows them to be extremely jealous, greedy, arrogant and even treacherous. This is something that many of the ancient world - including the Greek world - would rarely do to their own kind. Therefore, Herodotus is also one of the first examples of someone critquing their own culture.Herodotus makes it clear that the causes of conflict were complex - often stemming from selfishness, such as the Greek Histiaeus wanting to start an Ionian revolt just so he could leave the Persian court - and the ""heroes"" were no knights in shining armour. The best example is Themistocles, who was instrumental in saving Athens due to his insistence in forcing a sea battle in the Salamis straights. Rather than dying with the reputation as a heroe, he ended his life in excile collaborating with the Persians against Greece. It would be as if after leading the Americans to victory in the American Revelution and being President, George Washington was exciled to England and became and an advisor to the British king on how to retake America.While it may not have been his intention, one irony that becomes apparent regarding the Spartans and Athenians is that democratic Athens has an imperialist impulse from the outset of their victory at Salamis, while the oligarchic - some may even say proto-facist - state of Sparta is very reluctant to take any offensive measures and are rather content to stay in their peninsula. They were complaining about simply sending troops into central Greece to stop the Persians.Unfortunately, many ""progressive"" historians cut out the inconvenient truths of this history and make it into more of a black and white affair. For me, it was Herodotus' inquisitive mind, search for the truth - by revealing contridictory accounts - and, relative to ancient authors, very unbiased account that makes this work a must read for anyone interested in western civilization, ancient history, and world history in general."

Huxley is a must read for anyone contemplating retirement and for those who must manage money during retirement years. This book is written in a style that is easy to understand and grasp, and does not assume that the reader be a major in economics. The book is written in a clear lucid style and provides a very helpful education.What is novel about the book is that it shows for the first time, that it is possible to invest retirement savings in a manner that they meet the unique needs of each retirement situation. In other words, the books does not blindly advocate an asset mix as those found commonly on almost all mutual fund sites.The books advocates setting aside the appropriate mix of investments in high quality Bonds, while at the same time providing exposure to Index Stock Funds. But, there is no set magic ratio like 20/80 or 40/60 for Bonds/Stocks. Instead the book advocates and shows how you can set aside just enough money for income generation while at the same time gaining exposure to the stock market in increments of 3-10 years. The basic idea is to generate income for living expenses while at the same time gaining exposure to the stock market for adequate length of time. The book does not rely on just opinions. There is plenty of hard data and analysis to back up its premises.The calculations provided in the book can also be carried out on the Internet Site for those who would like to play out different scenarios of accumulated savings and interest rates.This book is a must read for anyone seriously contemplating retirement or anyone who is actively managing ones accumulated savings during retirement years. It provides a different working plan and perspective and one that should be reviewed.This book is a must read !"

This was a most chaotic time in Spider-Man's history, largely due to a mandate from Marvel bigwigs that the writers take a lesson from the Death of Superman hoopla and really shake up the whole comics universe with their own most popular hero. Normally, the very possibility of Peter Parker dying would have been inconceivable - but not at this particular time. Parker's life was a mess. Among other things, his Aunt May was in a coma, Mary Jane had left him, and he had pretty much descended into madness - to the point of dissociating himself from Peter Parker and his human past. Meanwhile, his not-dead-after-all clone, Ben Reilly, had returned and was already filling up the pages of Web of Spider-Man and Spider-Man as the Scarlet Spider in the four-part The Exile Returns storyline. Could it be that Reilly would take over after Parker's death? That was a question Spidey fans could not help but ask during this time - nor was it the only question, as speculation was building that the Peter Parker we had known and loved all these years, and not Ben Reilly, was in fact the clone.As this issue opens, Spidey has been poisoned by the sharp talons of the Vulture. Teamed up with Daredevil, he goes after the Owl and Vulture, knowing that his only hope for survival is in finding them and securing the antidote he hopes they have for the poison. Everything goes pretty much as you would expect - until the next to last pane, where we learn that, despite his newly found zest for life, Peter Parker still has one foot on the banana peel and the other in the grave.The whole Clone saga, of which Back From the Edge is a part, can be very confusing to even the casual Spider-Man fan - heck, it even proved confusing to the different Spider-Man writers at Marvel. It did serve its purpose in generating a lot of talk and controversy among fans, however, which makes this issue pretty darned important in the overall scheme of things."
158396102X,At the Earth's Core,15.5,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,Martin Asiner,5/6,4.0,1055548800,New Series New Hero But Still Enjoyable,"For Edgar Rice Burroughs, life was relatively simple. Men fell into one of three categories: muscular heroes, ordinary types, and evil, greasy villains. Women existed primarily to act as universal lighting rods that attracted either the first or third category. Regardless of the universe that ERB wrote of, these constants held with predictable regularity. With the publication of AT THE EARTH'S CORE, he began yet another series that put the hero at odds with nature, evil doers, and beautiful, virtuous women. David Innes, the handsome hero, drills down to the center of the earth in a manner that brings to mind Jules Verne's tale, both of which posit a habitable, temperate core that supports a variety of lush, prehistoric life. Despite knowing that the earth's core was held to be molten, ERB did not hesitate to bend science for the sake of a good tale. ATEC possesses both the plusses of ERB at his best and the negatives at his worst. Like Tarzan, Innes is a likable, manly sort who feels at home regardless of whether home is a jungle or a tea room. The logic of how ERB gets his hero placed in an exotic locale is irrelevant and often purely unscientific. For his Martian (Barsoom) series, he merely had his hero, John Carter, gaze at the Red Planet to effect his transport there. For his inner world series (Pellucidar), Innes used a drill machine, a device that at least tries to be scientific. Once there, Innes has the necessary adventures with beasts, villains, and beautiful women, in this case Dian the Beautiful. The workings of the plot about how he finds her, loses her, and then finds her again are almost not to the point. Where ERB excels in his ability to place the reader, who is usually a 15 year old boy, in a realm that allows imagination to run riot. Events flow so smoothly that the youthful reader will probably overlook the negatives of ERB's prose style. In the world of ERB's muscular heroes, both hero and villain speak in the artificial, courtly dialogue that rings true only to the ears of the young. Coincidence runs rife to the point of ridicule. Beautiful women are haughty at first, but lusty later, and then only to the clean-limbed hero. His plots are often mirror images of one another. You can substitute the center of the earth for Mars, Venus, Africa, or wherever, and hero, villain, and lovely lady are interchangeable. Yet, despite all this, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is the kind of read that ought to be part of any kid's early mental universe. Reading Burroughs as a thirty year old requires a strong ability to suspend one's disbelief, but once having done so, the ride is usually worth the effort."
B000MOOAJG,Atlas Shrugged,,A9GA6FCBPVDOW,Mitch,7/9,5.0,1079913600,Power of Thought,"Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand, presents a story about the struggle between good and evil. In doing so, an entire philosophy about business and life is developed. This philosophy teaches that the mind is the ultimate tool and power of civilization, and that reason is the world's only constant. Economics especially is highlighted by these ideas. Rational self interest and the pursuit of success are shown to be the only way people can achieve happiness. Rand uses brilliant, motivated industrialists as her protagonists in order to show the evils of charity and collectivism. Her book succeeds in getting across her points because of the way she employs logic, reason and intelligence into her characters and their actions.Who is John Galt? This strange question eventually comes to represent the central themes and events in this incredible book. Atlas Shrugged is mystery about the significance of this phrase and what it truly means. Telling the story of a railroad tycoon, a steel industrialist, an overly wealthy playboy, and several other characters, this book shows how they all play a part in the unraveling of the mystery.Many of the ideas presented by Atlas Shrugged focus on the central importance of the mind in human civilization. The protagonist of the book is Dagny Taggert, a young, brilliant railroad owner who succeeds because of the way she overcomes her problems through rational thought. Most of the other main characters are also extremely intelligent businessmen who have gained their place in life because of the way they use their minds. These characters are contrasted by the ""looters"", people who expect to be carried by the successful people and seek moral sympathy because of their positions in life. In one passage Rand writes, ""Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce(806). This is shown by Rand as the only real evil of the world. Rand's ideas of the difference between right and wrong is very black and white in this book. Characters are either good or they are bad and this judgment is usually based on how they use their minds. This sharp contrast is helpful in the book because it makes the ideas presented clearer, however it also makes it seem a bit less realistic. Overall the book does well at showing that the mind is the most important aspect and also the driving force behind civilization.Rand's economic principles shine through very brightly in Atlas Shrugged. Capitalism and free trade are shown as the tools of success and happiness. Many of her ideas about how people should act towards themselves and others in dealing with money are also explained through the story. Charity is viewed as evil and degrading. In one point in the book, Rearden, an extremely successful industrialist, is asked by his mother if he will give his incompetent younger brother a job, just because he is his brother. Rearden then says, ""Are you asking me to stage a fraud of that kind? I don't know what it is that you call morality. If I gave Philip a job, I wouldn't be able to face any competent man who needed work and deserved it(196-197)."" In this book, personal achievement and self-interest are stressed as the right way to live while thinking of or giving to others is viewed as the root of evil. John Galt says at one point, ""I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine(622). Rand believes people have no obligation towards others, except to not impede on their rights of free will and self interest. In this way, selfish behavior is shown as a virtue, while giving to the undeserving is blamed as the source of many of society's problems. This idea is very different from what is normally taught and its uniqueness makes it interesting. Even though it may go against certain beliefs and moral values, the teachings of this book are hard not to share because of the reason and intelligence that Rand gives them.Atlas Shrugged is well worth reading, even at 1100 pages, because of its intelligence and unique outlook on life. Everything in this book makes sense and is logical, even if you don't agree with it. Views and opinions are explained and backed up using the story as a guide. The way this book is written does not allow for someone to be neutral on what is put forth. Either you agree strongly with what is being said or you disagree strongly. Either way, Rand's writing is gripping and interesting. It forces you to think about what she is saying and form your own opinion about it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something that will make them use their intelligence."

Evading capture is not just about his cleverness; the search and the bungles along the way, as well as some very lucky breaks are what helped Mengele stay out of the clutches of the War Crimes courts.It was a great read for those who have already researched the horrors of the holocaust and in particular Mengele's role in studying twins."

The truth is that the difficulty is overstated and the down-to-earthness is what really comes through in the end.Give yourself to this book and it will reward you endlessly. I defy anyone not to laugh, cry and be thoroughly moved when they read it in full. It is the funniest, most affirmative piece of art I've ever come across, and deserves its place at the top of the tree in twentieth century literature."

0688172229,"Double Billing: A Young Lawyer's Tale Of Greed, Sex, Lies, And The Pursuit Of A Swivel Chair",14.99,A3AAX9AO0CIFBI,J. Taylor,14/14,4.0,981244800,A good description of the legal industry,"In Double Billing: A Young Lawyer's Tale of Greed, Sex, Lies, and the Pursuit of a Swivel Chair, author Cameron Stracher provides the reader with an in-depth look at working in a prominent New York firm based on his real life experiences. Stracher's main character is an unnamed attorney recently graduated from Harvard Law who is starting as a first year associate at the fictional firm of Crowley &amp; Cavanaugh (C&amp;C). But before proceeding with his character's experiences from day one, he provides the reader with the basic layout of our litigious society. Indeed, that the legal industry exists for itself is a sub-theme of his book. ""[P]eace is bad business for the peacemakers,"" he writes.Starting in C&amp;C's litigation department, Stracher's character faces mountainous discovery tasks and endless workweeks. He accurately explains that much of his work is completely unnecessary, and that the only reason he performs it is because his prominent firm can afford it, just in case it needs it. ""If one associate could do the research, why not two? If one motion might succeed, what about a second? We threw everything into the pot and hoped something would rise. If it didn't, at least our bills would be paid."" He adds that ""because C&amp;C's fees were paid out of an insurance policy, with each payment reducing the amount that would be left for settlement, the insurance company had little incentive to insist on a settlement now."" Hence, given that much of his work was really unnecessary, he genuinely felt detached from the general and important issues in his cases. He also expresses disappointment at not having the opportunity to argue in court. However, his disappointment subsides when he learns that the partner in charge of the case has never argued in court at all.Stracher's character holds no bitterness or animosity towards his work. Rather, his on-the-job experiences bewilder and constantly amuse him as he labors for hours on end. He strikes a chord with law students and lawyers when he laments that ""[t]he more you learn about a case, the more you need to know,"" and, ""if only I could understand what I've been reading."" Such musings remind me of a frustrated classmate who, trying to understand a concept in Civil Procedure, cried ""I'm confused about what I'm confused about."" As Stracher's character expresses his frustrations, he discovers that he ""doesn't know what he doesn't know."" Such expressions abound throughout the book.Stracher strikes another chord when he analyzes his decision to attend law school. ""[I] believe the law school migration is equally widespread, and peculiar to my generation,"" he writes. ""Law school has become the graduate school for the great unwashed, the final resting place for a plurality of college graduates without an employable degree."" He further writes that ""law school is the most hospitable locale for undergraduates with no specific expertise."" Indeed, students with life-long goals of working in fields such as medicine, engineering, architecture and other professions greatly outweigh those who grow up desiring to attend law school and enter the legal world.Stracher's character experiences other frustrations at C&amp;C, such as a constant lack of feedback, difficult coworkers and working throughout weekends. That the smell of late night Chinese food brings back instant memories of a conference room full of boxes of documents only accentuates the monotony and besieged mentality he feels at C&amp;C. Hence, his sense of constantly being overwhelmed is another theme of the book.As Stracher's character leaves C&amp;C as a third-year associate, Stracher concludes, ""law, particularly as it was practiced at C&amp;C and other big corporate firms, was also unique among capitalist enterprises. It produced no goods, rarely addressed substantive issues, almost never provided closure, pitted lawyers against each other in the struggle for partnership, isolated lawyers in the library and their offices, tended to weed out the sociable and genial."" In essence, Stracher describes the big firm life as a surreal existence, where lawyers thrive on tediousness and ambiguity. However, he feels no disdain towards law. He soon begins working ""in a different legal setting, where I was in court more often and confronting the merits of cases rather than the procedural grind, [where] my work would be more meaningful."" He embraces his new work experience, which invokes more of a human element and where ""they praise rigorous work, not take it for granted.""Stracher applies much humor into his writing style, which gives the book a healthy rhythm. For instance, he mentions how he finds a rival attorney's office for a deposition when his eye catches a sign ""that warns: Attorneys-at-Law."" Overall, he writes with an engaging determination to ""tell it like it was."" This makes the book even harder to put down. The only problem is that the title is somewhat misleading. There isn't any sex, and no one really lies about anything. Moreover, there really isn't any double billing in the sense that most people would assume. Where most people might think of double billing as improperly billing twice for work performed, Stracher explains that the dedication to winning the war of attrition that is discovery, where as many associates as possible are used to labor unceasingly in a battle of documents and depositions, constitutes real double billing. He thoroughly explains this when he paraphrase a partner crying ""Give them something to do, anything; make them bill!"" For law students desiring a big firm experience, Stracher's book provides a reasonable idea of what to expect."
B0006ARFDO,The Moon and Sixpence: A Novel,,A187BR9OB7MS30,eagle eye,4/8,2.0,1197936000,I'd suggest cakes and ale,"This is very far from Maugham's best (to me, his short stories and novellas). The character, Strickland, genius painter perhaps based on Gauguin, is just not believable. Real great artists (such as Gauguin) may be odd in their personal lives, but they do spend time with other artists, they do discuss art; they don't seem to be the ignorant brutes this fellow is. The book feeds off a popular idea of the artist as outsider, and certainly there have been many who were. Yet even Van Gogh, exemplary nutter genius, talked to other painters, including Gauguin. Strickland's art comes out of a personal vacuum, which seems unrealistic.So unlikely is the main character that before the book ended I lost interest and stopped reading. For a better book by Maugham on the unexpected personal life of great artists, read Cakes and Ale instead."

0762405651,Little Women (Courage giant classics),,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",3/4,5.0,1296172800,From little women to good wives,"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but ""Little Women"" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of ""Little Women"" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, ""poor little rich boy"" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to ""Little Women."" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- ""scribbling"" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But ""Little Women"" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as ""heartwarming"" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the ""perfect little homemaker"" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.""Little Women"" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."

Uh oh!,"Prof. Bak weaves a rather uncaptivating tapestry with threads of fact, leaps of faith, fragile arguments and plain conjectures. He is repetitive, argumentative, anecdotal and at times abrasive (giving me the excuse to reply in kind).One-size-fits-all theories have fallen flat on their faces, more so when trying to unify physical phenomena with those involving deliberate human actions. An example of a &quot;leap of faith&quot; is his idea of labeling the act of human intervention on an existing system as coming from a slightly modified system', leading to similar dynamical behavior as before. The treatment of &quot;chaos&quot; is weak and dismissive - when a distinction between &quot;criticality&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot; and &quot;randomness&quot; would have helped get rid of baggage the author wants the reader so desperately to forget.In the first half of the book, Prof Bak has quoted Al Gore.

B000NWWBMA,Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation,,A26RWQYHUPG1P,Michael O'Brien,2/4,5.0,1030924800,Best Book I Heave Read On Revolutionary Era,"This book gives an intimate insight into the key players of our revolution. I have found that there are two primary styles in describing people:1) Facts and Statistics. By giving a chronology of their birth, upbringing, education, and accomplishments, you gain a 3rd-person understanding of a person's life.2) Key Stories. By telling one or two stories about someone, you may not know where they went to school, who they married, etc., but done well, you can capture the essence of a person.Although a good biography mixes both facts and stories, biographies usually focus on a specific person. By profiling a group of people and telling stories about their interactions, you gain an added dimension -- you understand how their mix of personalities shaped history, and how history shaped them.Using different historical backdrops, including Hamilton and Burr's duel, the silence over slavery, the dinner in which the Potomac was picked to be our capitol, etc., you gain not only an in-depth understanding of these issues, but you come to truly understand what made each person tick. You come to see them as humans with great strengths as well as great weaknesses.I came away with a better understanding about how each personality of our founding fathers manifested itself into our current system of governance. Each brilliant, left to their own devises, this country may not have survived. Yet in this volatile period, the best of each person bubbled to the top, and allowed a nation to be formed that has thrived for over 200 years."

The viciousness, intended and otherwise, of these policies and practices is told from the point of view of the Indian peoples who had to undergo this &quot;my way or the highway&quot; approach as they were moved relentless into the concentration areas we like to call reservations.The destruction brought upon the Indians from the attempts of Lord Amherst, in pre-revolutionary time, to kill them off with presents of blankets infected with smallpox, to the slaughter of Iriquois women and children in upstate New York during Washington's administration, to the indifference of Jefferson to landgrabs from the Indians in violation of treaties which the government never intended to abide by, to the seizures of Indian land encouraged by the Indian-hating Andrew Jackson, is all there down to the political manipulation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in our own time.For one not familiar with the real history of how the American Indian was violently removed from the land, this book will be an eye-opener. One of a very few histories, which shows how this was experienced by the Indian and the Indian response down to the present day. The heros and the villians are there in abundanceA highly readable book."

However, this turned out to be a HUGE disappointment - so much so that I ended up skipping after 100 pages to the end because I just couldn't take it anymore. The heroine, Ellie, is extremely annoying, whose personality apparently dictated that she act like a waspish, humorless shrew towards the hero, who was nothing but kind and charming to her. Also, there were huge chunks of the book where NOTHING was happening except for the boring and increasingly annoying back-and-forth dialogue between Ellie and Charles, which did nothing to advance the story. It got to be so annoying that I had to stop. You could tell Ms. Quinn was trying very hard to be witty in these passages, but it fell spectacularly flat. Would not recommend."

1400095506,The Unfinished Novel and Other Stories,13.0,A1TDU9KYO4EFE4,"Mark A. Underwood ""knowlengr""",1/1,4.0,1233619200,Portrait of the Artists' Inner Circle,"Valerie Martin's short story collection, The Unfinished Novel and Other Stories (Vintage, 2006) reflects the sure hand at narration and psychological insight revealed in her earlier worksA Recent Martyr (Voices of the South)andMary Reilly.One might quibble with the focal characters-- selected from the artistic elites (honored but marginalized, depending upon your point of view). Writers may perhaps be forgiven for dallying in the subcommunities that most fascinate them, but authors of literary fiction are scrutinized even more savagely for this defect. But, as if to blunt this criticism, Martin's elites are foils for artists' inner circle of friends, lovers, acquaintances, teachers. Martin avoids several all too common pitfalls: absurd ""arteest"" idiosyncracies, sycophantic reverence for the creative process regardless of the interpersonal havoc it wreaks, but mostly, unsympathetically flat depictions of an underserved supporting cast.Consider this brief excerpt from the opening story, ""His Blue Period."" Martin's craft interweaves the ordinary and a modestly elevated literacy.""I spent the rest of the morning trying to paint, but I got nowhere. I could see the painting of Maria's hands clutching the edge of a chute, and behind her, that ominous blue, Anspach's blue period, waiting to swallow her up forever. In the afternoon I picked up my daughter, Bridget, from her school, and we spent an hour at the corner library. When we got back home, Yvonne was there, standing at the kitchen counter, chopping something. Was she still mad at me from the morning? I went up beside her on the pretense of washing my hands. 'Day okay?' I said.""Nor is Martin fearful of giving her characters a philosophical voice wedged between ordinary dialog. In ""The Open Book"" Edith says,""It all felt dismally familiar. They were at the middle point of an argument they had been through a thousand times: reason versus passion, vitality versus stability. Sometimes, when Isabel was so frustrated and stymied by her career that she became depressed and Edith had to buck her up, they had even switched sides. But this time a resolution of those irreconcilable differences would have to be found, for it was not just philosophies that were at odds but material possibilities.""I found myself in a pleasantly distracting daze contemplating each of these stories taking flight as finished novels, had Martin chosen the loftier form. She has some brutal plot twists in store here, but to those of us who have read Valerie Martin before, it's as the narrator in ""The Unfinished Novel"" says: ""I was fixed between curiosity and foreboding, and stymied by the unsettling feeling of having done this before."""

The author is an exceptionally gifted writer and good storyteller, who I think does an excellent job of capturing one of the most unforgettable moments in recent time...the late 60's. It is nostalgic without being overly sentimental, and I found the characters to be ""real"" people with universal qualities that are instantly appealing. The setting takes place in a small rural town, and I especially enjoyed the author's very lush descriptions of the natural beauty of the area, and how he wove this aspect of the story into the overall plot. Anyone who is a sucker for a ""first love"", coming-of-age story, but perhaps seeking a fresh approach, should read this book."

Dougherty,4/4,4.0,1238976000,2nd Most definitive Complination of Service Records of Continental Officers,"This book is a ""must"" for researchers of the American Revolutionary War and genealogists working on their family trees.The author put together a list of all know officers in the COntinental Army and the various militias in 1892, and this book is a fascimile reproduction of author Heitman's book published in 1893. The author believed that he had entries for 90% of all such officers. The entries mostly give each officer's rank upon entry into service, dates of promotion, units, and other facts such as when captured, paroled, exchanged, killed, etc.However, for serious researchers this book was supplanted by a ""New, Revised, and Enlarged Edition"" in 1914 (Rare Book Shop Publishing Company) that contains more material, lists and entries. In my own research, the 1914 edition has proven to be more useful, so I recommend it in preference to the 1893 edition. Unfortunately, the 1914 edition is now rare and very difficult to find, so for the average researcher the reprint of the 1893 edition is far better than nothing."

Arguments are raging online in Civil War groups and writer's groups. He speaks for a dead soldier from a defeated country -- apparently who saw his wounded friends' faces eaten off by wild hogs stalking Civil War battlefields at night. This is a cult book in the making. He wrote online that he's had to drop the internet because six people have sent him viruses after reading ""The Hogs of Cold Harbor"".This author is a hot potato. Drop him if you can't take the heat. Hold him a little while and his work is delicious, well written, horrifying -- and as a reviewer at ""Civil War News"" said ""as brutal and ironic as a Civil War"". He brings a dead soldier to life. He reminds me of Remarque in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". IMO there is no better writer working in America today."
B000KDZAFC,Man's Search for Meaning,,A2X4AEWNWCA1NX,Mal Warwick,0/0,4.0,1361145600,"From the ashes of the Holocaust, a gift of lessons for living","""Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning."" This is the conclusion that a young Viennese psychiatrist, Viktor E. Frankl, reached in the course of more than three years in a succession of four Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The book he wrote in the space of nine days in 1946, originally under another title, morphed over the years into the thin volume known around the world today as Man's Search for Meaning. It has sold more than 12 million copies and been translated into 24 languages, serving as a source of inspiration and solace for millions of people. Man's Search for Meaning is frequently cited as one of the most important books of the 20th Century.Frankl's almost matter-of-fact description of his years in concentration camps is profoundly moving, the more so because it's a fiercely personal document and makes no attempt to relate the familiar statistics now surrounding the topic or to place the Nazi phenomenon in historic perspective. Frankl writes simply about how he personally managed to remain hopeful in the face of staggering brutality, including the murder of his young wife at Bergen-Belsen and the death of numberless friends and colleagues. As Frankl relates, their deaths came not only at the hands of SS guards but also, at least equally, as the result of sadistic behavior by the ""Capos,"" prisoners themselves raised to positions of authority and privilege by the Nazis. The effect of reading this material is searing. Here, God is truly in the details.However, Frankl's story about life in the concentration camps is only one of several parts in Man's Search for Meaning. The edition I read included five pieces written over more than half a century by three different authors: a foreword by Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, an Afterword by William J. Winslade, and three articles by Frankl. The first of these three, ""Experiences in a Concentration Camp,"" has received the most attention from non-professionals. The second, ""Logotherapy in a Nutshell,"" is Frankl's brief summary of the principles and procedures of logotherapy, the ""third school"" of Viennese psychiatry that Frankl created -- an approach that's often termed ""existential psychiatry."" (Somehow, Carl Jung seems to have gotten lost in the numbering system -- perhaps because he was Swiss, not Viennese.) Frankl also wrote a ""Postscript 1984&#8243; bearing the title, ""The Case for a Tragic Optimism."" And all this writing fits comfortably into a remarkably thin little volume.Intellectually, Frankl's abbreviated introduction to logotherapy for the layperson, was the most intriguing part of the book. The term itself is derived from the much-used Greek word, logos, which has been applied to all manner of pursuits in philosophy, rhetoric, and religion. Frankl took it to mean something like ""meaning."" He rejected the determinism of Freudian and Adlerian psychiatry, insisting that neither approach was useful in treating more than a minority of psychological problems. In his own practice and that of the students under his supervision in a series of top Viennese hospitals, Frankl found that many psychological problems could be easily cured by one or a few conversations between the patient and the logotherapist. Logotherapy involved no years-long sojourns on the analyst's couch. (In fact, patients sat in chairs.) He cites many cases of ingrained phobic and compulsive behavior that he and his disciples cured by somehow convincing patients not to worry about their behavior. A lifelong stutterer, for example, was cured when he was persuaded to enter conversations unconcerned about stuttering -- and the cure was lasting. A fellow physician transcended his depression over the loss of his wife in a single, short conversation with Frankl. The essential truth of logotherapy is as Frankl discovered in the camps: so long as we maintain a powerful commitment to some life goal outside our present circumstances, we can get through practically any privation.Man's Search for Meaning should be in everyone's library. The lessons Viktor Frankl teaches can be applied to challenges in any culture and all walks of life."

To me, books are supposed to be what they say they are. If I'm reading a fantasy, I want to read about some wild land with a great story, good details, and witty dialog. If I'm reading a biography, I want pure objectivity. Same with a history book, don't give me a one sided obsessive story about history.Having said that, this book clearly blows away any and all expectations I had going in. From roughly page 100 on, this book is so amazing, so unbelievable, and so riveting that I could not put it down - literally. I began driving to work the long way so I could read at red lights. I would read while brushing my teeth at night. I would read on my lunch break at work. It's been a long time since any book has captivated my like this.On the cover of the book is the statement, ""The Most Incredible Story You'll Ever Read."" While this is a strong statement, it lived up to it for me. It really stands as one of the most incredible stories I have ever read. Granted, this is only the second book of this ilk that I have read (Black Hawk Down was the first), but it really was amazing.I'm not going to give away the story/plot of the book. You get all you need to know from the fact that it deals with a British SAS unit which goes into Iraq during the brief war in 1991. Stuff happens. Really, it's not my story to tell. The editorial reviews above detail the story better (and more in depth) than I can do here. What I'm trying to do is give you an idea if the book met my expectations and if the experience in reading it was good or bad.This book is well written, it displays an amazing set of circumstances that this team went through, and it gives you a real insightful look at how the SAS team operates. The author is the same man who led the expedition, so the information is first rate. In addition, you learn a good amount about the culture of the ""enemy"" of the moment, namely the Iraqis.As an exercise in completeness, I read the reviews which gave this book low ratings. I find that reading the ratings are a fair way to look at the good and bad reviews any book gets and better solidify or objectify my view. I did not find a thing to sway me from the 5 star rating. Yes, there are British expressions in the book that can be confusing at times. But this is a small detail that should not deter you.A really, really good book. Highly recommended."

Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of ""acceptable"" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one's status.This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen's later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.-----------------------"

Kirkman ""book jen""",1/1,5.0,1167436800,"This book is wonderful with humor, love, and life changes.","Colleen Collins was down and out, living in her home in D.C., in the throes of depression with the loss of her boyfriend and her job as a journalist. The company she was working for had a big lawsuit against them, and tried to blame Collie for part of the problem.Then a few months later after wallowing in misery, she is offered an assignment in Saline Texas, and takes it. There she finds new adventures and discovers what Texas living is like. First of all, she rents a car right from the airport, and gets lost along the way. And not only that, but her car breaks down too. So not knowing what to do, she sees a place up ahead, ""True the Tractor Man,"" tractors. Of course True tells her how to get to Hawthorne House, where she will stay for the next several days there. She and Mrs. Hawthorne strike up an instant friendship-and Mrs. Hawthorne knows everyone in town there, including True and his whole history.As Colleen meets True again, the two begin to fall in love. But True has his own complex set of issues and is a little afraid of getting too close. He puts out his own paper each week, and doesn't really do a very good job. This is also where Colleen comes in, but True resents her at first trying to help, and making fun of her journalism skills-that is until he sees what she does with the paper.A few days go on, and Colleen falls in love with the people there, but is in a dilemma when the lawsuit back home gets out of control, and she is wanted back for reporting again. And not only that, but she is wanted at the Post, a huge newspaper, where she will have a bigtime job there, and make piles of money-but she really isn't sure this is what she wants any longer now. There is a contract to be signed at this firm for 2 years at least, and Colleen is definitely not into this idea, even though she has returned home. Her heart is still in Texas, and she has a terrible decision to make."

The discussion is sometimes hard - so hard that one of the partipicipants in the conference withdraw her contribution as a protest against one of the papers in the book! As I see it, the main difference in the discussion about ancient goddess religion is between those scholars who accept the evidence for a goddess religion and those who try to explain it away. Both these positions are well represented in this book. On one hand we have scholars like Christina Biaggi who begin from the archaeological evidence and try to interpret it - on the other hand we have those like Brian Hayden who are engaging in a frenzied polemic against all those who argue for a goddess religion. Hayden is an interesting example of academic denial - he could be seen as an almost archetypical case!The book can be recommended for those who likes to read different opinions on this interesting subject and compare them."
B000OVTKTC,Interview With The Vampire,,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,David Bonesteel,0/1,5.0,1047081600,Brilliant novel delivers more than just horror,"Anne Rice's fascinating novel catapulted her into literary superstardom and redefined the vampire for the modern age. A trio of vampires--Lestat, comfortable with his nature and capable of reveling in his power and cruelty; Louis, conflicted by his dark cravings but unable to resist them; and Claudia, tortured by being forever trapped in the body of a six-year-old girl--provide the prism through which we are introduced to a meticulously crafted vampire underworld that exists parallel to our own. Those who are put off by the dark, mopey, tragically romantic, gothic cliche that the vampire has become should not be deterred from reading this book, even though it is responsible for launching that cliche. Rice's prose is lovely and there is much interesting contemplation on the nature of evil and redemption. Not to mention a great story as well."

B00089YABI,My musical life,,,,6/9,2.0,949017600,"Great music, inconsequential text","Rimsky-Korsakov's reallife personality exhibited signs of a clear split. His outward manner was dry, didactic, taciturn, argumentative, fussy and straight-laced. But to those who knew him more personally--his family, his friends, and those who saw his actions, rather than his words-- the man who emerged was kind, thoughtful, generous, colorful, provocative, and uncoventional in the extreme.Unfortunately, My Musical Life carefully maintains the public persona with which Rimsky-Korsakov walled off his private thoughts. You'll look in vein for what led this one-time career naval officer to write several operas which cast the Tsar and his court as buffoons and lackeys, causing his work to be banned; or for any analysis of either his music or its generation. This musical life is a series of dull, faded pictures; dull not because of images whose meaning has been lost to cultural changes, but because the pictures are deliberately bland reminiscences of a man who did not care to extend his confidence to strangers."

Harriet Beecher Stowe would be amazed with the improvements America has made. There is still a tremendous amount of hatred, racism and prejudice occurring today. Tom's morality gave strength to those around him. Close to one hundred years later Dr. King's anti-violent moral deliverance gave strength to those around him!

This particular novel, however, woke up something in me. It's a beautifully written piece about a passion that goes unchecked, leading a man to his doom. What's august about this piece is that the reader has a hard time deciding if the man (Heathcliff) did in fact deserve his fate. The novel deals with very difficult psychological subjects-when forgiveness should be blessed on those who have wronged you and what one should value in one's life. It is enraptured by violence, yet there is not mention of any violent scenes. Amorous to its very essence, but sadly disappointing for those expecting erotic moments. It deals with the very basis of man but mixes universal raisons d'etre with individual idiosyncrasies of the characters. It is, in short, an amazing novel and Emily Bronte should be admired for still being able to connect with readers years after her death."
B000GW4AH6,Dandelion Wine,,,,1/3,2.0,937699200,I rate this book low because it was hard to follow.,"I thought that this book was confusing do to the fact that every chapter of the book would change course to a new character or place. In one chapter, they talked about Doug(the maincharacter)and how he is in a light tower imaginating that he is waking the town by using magic. Then the next chapter has Doug in the woods with his dad and brother. Since the confusion made the book hard to follow, it didn't appeal to me and most of my fellow classemates that read it. On the other hand, I thought the book had the potential to be very intresting if the flow was consitant. The life of Doug, a 12-year-old boy, is one that I could relate to. The losses of friends and family through out the book is one thing I can relate to. I have lost a few family members, but more than a handful of friends. The way Doug moves on in life is what I to do. So, in a way feel a sort of conection with Doug. It is kind of hard for me to give a review for a book that I really didn't understand but, from what I did pick up from the book was not too bad. I recomond this book to a reader that has a high compotision and can follow non-flowing books. For readers like me, who like to only read books that will keep us interstead through out the book, Dandelion Wine is not the book for you."

Ms. Richard has a witty and entertaining style of writing, which makes this book a genuine pleasure to read. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone on a low carb diet who does not have access to the Internet, or who does not have the time or patience to weed through millions of posts on Internet support boards in order to find those few pearls of wisdom that are always hiding among a proliferation of other posts.This book includes a brief individual summary of each of the following low carb plans:the Atkins dietthe Carbohydrate Addict's Dietthe ZoneSugar Busters!Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes SolutionProtein PowerThe Schwarzbein PrincipleNeanderthinThin forGoodThe Secret to Low Carb Success also provides this summary in the form of a chart, allowing you to compare all of the plans side-by-side. You can reference subjects like caffeine on another comparison chart and see what each of the individual author's opinions is on a given subject.One of the most helpful sections of this book and will no doubt be Chapter 2, ""Know What to Expect."" This is where you get the real nitty-gritty -- the lowdown on how much weight you can really expect to lose on a typical low carbohydrate plan, the definition of a true stall and plateau versus the typical periods of slow or no loss that plague all of us, and a discussion of ""whooshes"" as well as ""set points"" and ""natural body weights"" that are difficult to move beyond. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of how muscle growth masks fat loss, and how, as we all know, ""scales are for fish"".The book goes on to discuss how water retention masks fat loss. She explains it very well: since a pint is a pound the world around, the weight of the water that we drink and retain fluctuates daily.Another very valuable section has been devoted to the subject of hidden carbs. Very few of the official diet plan books even touch upon this so-important subject. This book includes images of actual nutritional labels, and it drives this important point home very well.The author has cleverly combined the advice of many successful dieters into one easy-to-read narrative. Bravo, Laura Richard!"

I didn't get that impression from the book, which I felt was a scathing endictment of both the radicals and the mainstream Mormons.

We were both in agreement that the story did not encroach on the classic Alice in Wonderland or Through the Looking Glass. Mr. Beddor held his own in this novel even though he draws upon Lewis Carroll's original characters. Still he was able to create a very interesting fantasy. To parents there are some scenes that are graphic with violence and in my opinion this book would be one you might want to check out before your 9 or 10 year old or reads it. Just a word of caution.

Sure, it's a bit slow in the early chapters, but what part of any Dickens work doesn't have its moments. The cast of characters is diverse, as usual, and bring different social circumstances to the Gordon Riots in 1780 England. The chapters devoted to the Riot itself are packed with action that kept me reading far past my normal quitting time. More importantly, Dickens paints a vivid picture of both religious persecution and the irrational and unpredictable quality of a widespread riot. With brief references to the War for Independence, the novel serves as a solid insight into some of the thinking that led our Founding Fathers to enshrine fundamental liberties in the Bill of Rights.The academic review that precedes the novel is a waste of time for any reader for enjoyment and a perfect example of the horrid quality of writing in academia today. The reviewer needs to spend less time assembling critical comment and spend some time learning how to write like Dickens."

I first saw acopy several years ago and was disappointed to learn that thehardcover version was out of print. The book has short narrative sections that provide insight into Shaker history, work, and communal and spiritual life. One section captures a &quot;typical&quot; day in the life of the Brethren and Sisters. The enlarged font is easy on the eyes and the top of each narrative page is headed by the famous Shaker wall pegs. The narrative sections are separated by numerous pages of high quality, well-captioned color photographs of Shaker crafts, furniture, and architecture. Lots of beautiful pictures! The Shakers legacy still seems to have a profound impact on our contemporary lives in spite of (or perhaps because of) the simplicity of their work and their unusual communal way of life. Although this book does not present a comprehensive history of the Shakers, it does an admirable job of providing an insight into the lives of these interesting people. This book is deserving of any coffee table and should get a lot of attention in your household. END"
B000GLO6NK,A Darker Shade of Crimson,,,,0/0,2.0,891216000,Disappointing.,"When I first heard about this book, I was really excited because of its African-American author and characters, but it soon became obvious that the reader has to have been at an ivy-league college to get into this book. Not being an ivy-grad, I found it very hard to relate to much of anything in it. The writing style seems like the front page of the Wall Street Journal. The characters seem either flat or cliche (and by cliche I mean REALLY cliche). Books about successful African-American characters should inspire to be like them, but this one sure doesn't.

McCall,4/4,4.0,1093305600,"Wonderful story, beautiful illustrations, sloppy text pages","The writing, of course, gets five stars.Until recently, my favorite story was represented on my bookshelf by yellowed paperbacks from the `70s. I went shopping for a durable hardcover edition that would better reflect my love of Tolkien's masterwork.Having enjoyed Alan Lee's work as a designer on the Peter Jackson films and his exquisite illustrations in the book CASTLES, my choice did not take long to make. I was not disappointed.Lee's watercolors are detailed and evocative without imposing on the reader's own imagination. Although there are several portraits and battle scenes, characters are usually dwarfed by the vast landscapes and imaginative architecture that Lee excels at rendering. Tangled untamed forests, crumbling castles, and savage mountainscapes abound. These illustrations hold up to repeated viewings. The prevailing atmosphere may seem grim to those readers who may expect vibrant, children's book colors. The picket-fenced charm of Bag End, for example, is sombered by autumn leaves flying before dark gathering clouds.Although I highly recommend this edition, I cannot quite give it five stars. The print quality of the text pages is not up to that of the color inserts. The type is nice and large, but it is often broken up or flecked with fuzz, as if the plates are wearing out after multiple printings. Also the maps are weakly reproduced, unlike the large red-and-black foldouts I enjoy in my copies of THE SILMARILLION and UNFINISHED TALES. Indeed, these are quibbles, but for the hefty suggested retail price, I hoped for perfection!"

B0006EX1ZG,The marriage builder: A blueprint for couples and counselors : now with discussion guide for couples,,A25AMBAAZLNTQT,"Robert W. Kellemen ""Doc. K.""",11/12,5.0,1125532800,Soul Mates: Becoming Your Spouse's Spiritual Friend,"""The Marriage Builder"" by Dr. Larry Crabb has become something of a classic in the genre of Christian books on husband-wife relationships. In it, Crabb highlights three relational areas: the couple's spiritual relationship to God, their social/soul relationship to one another, and their physical relationship to each other. When dealt with properly, and in priority order, Crabb asserts that relationships will be healthy (not necessarily happy, since that is not God's goal nor guarantee for life this side of heaven).Discussing the spiritual relationship, Crabb explains that when God cleanses sin through salvation, His grace simultaneous quenches the deepest thirsts in the human soul. Rather than beings some new-age mantra as some claim when they critique Crabb, the concept of longings, desires, thirsts, and hunger is both biblical and historical (church history). The Trinitarian God of the Bible created humanity in His relational image. Since human beings are finite, they will always long for the infinite--for God's infinite holy love.Once a husband and wife have come to understand that all they need is God and what He chooses to provide, Crabb notes that then they can quit the old ""tic on a dog"" relationship of mutual manipulation. Instead, they can begin a relationship of mutual ministry.In this area, Crabb explores God's essential design for the masculine and feminine soul. He posits that males have a deep social longing for respect, which coincides with Paul's teaching in Ephesians 5. Crabb also explains that females have a deep social longing for intimacy, also correlating with Paul's teaching in Ephesians 5.As couples learn to drink fully from the God of the universe and to serve one another ""heapin' helpins'"" of respect and intimacy, then they are prepared to experience body oneness (not simply fun sex). One in their walk with God, one in their relationship with each other, now they move toward physical oneness.""The Marriage Builder"" is a classic because it remains true to God's classic teaching on relationships. We are spiritual beings designed to worship God; we are social beings designed to mutually minister to and intimately connect with one another; and we are physical beings, designed in the state of marital matrimony, to experience body oneness.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of ""Soul Physicians,"" ""Spiritual Friends,"" and the forthcoming, ""Beyond the Suffering: The Story of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction."""

Six hours later, I was agape, in denial and most certainly scandalized. Without giving away the plot, suffice to say that Dame Agatha had written her ultimate masterpiece when she decided to write &quot;...Roger Ackroyd&quot;.For first-time readers: Don't be fooled by the length of the novel. The clues are there, sprinkled neatly and merrily along with the darned red herrings. You have to read it slowly, as it was with most of her novels.The story: a doctor was called by Roger Ackroyd to discuss an important matter, but before he could divulge it further he was interuppted by the evening post. The matter was left there, and the doctor went home, seeing his host a bit disturbed. When he got home another call came in and announced that Mr Ackroyd was dead. Thus Poirot came into the scene and began nosing around. The solution was truly one of the most surprising in literature history.The novel became the measuring rod for future mystery and detective novels, although its controversy is undeniable. My suggestion is that you ignore the controversy for the moment and concentrate on the story."

It meanders and never gets to the point. Perhaps the writer meant to be impressionistic, but doesn't have the skill to really pull that off. Perhaps it was too literally translated, but I don't think that was the real problem. The translator seems to do well enough with the material he was presented with, even providing some explanatory footnotes for historical terms and aspects of life in the former GDR. And his translator's essay at the end of the book is superior to Hensel's jottings. I doubt Hensel is the right person to provide an interesting reminiscense of growing up in East Germany, or life since then. My suspicion is that this is a book by the kind of individual who gets by regardless of the kind of country they find themselves living in. For a far more sympathetic and sensitive look at the same theme, try the film ""Goodbye, Lenin"". This book already has a huge number of used copies available, and there's a reason for that."
159457250X,Common Sense Purchasing: Hard Knock Lessons Learned From a Purchasing Pro,29.95,A3BSGOSBUUU29W,W. Fitch,13/15,2.0,1106092800,What this book is REALLY about!,"I bought this book, in no small part, because of the rave reviews that it's gotten on this site. Now that I've spent half of my day thoroughly reading this 76 page gem, I'm kind of astounded by what's been written about it. In spite of my rating, I don't consider it to be a bad book. If you're the manager of a purchasing department within a large manufacturing firm looking to reengineer your operations, I recommend that you read it. However, if you're looking for sound advice on general purchasing practices, look elsewhere.This book seems to have been thrown together fairly quickly. It contains numerous typos, and poorly drawn cartoons that add little to it. Nonetheless, the author does dispense some practical advice on modernizing a purchasing organization, and how to sell the plan to affected individuals. He principally focuses on computer automation, developing procurement card programs, and developing ""strategic relationships"" with suppliers. This last notion refers to his belief that strong business relationships should be forged with important suppliers to get them more fully involved in meeting the company's needs (automatic inventory replenishment and the like). On the whole, the book seems to be more about modern (late 90's theory) operations management than about purchasing, but at least the points that the author does make seem sound. Unfortunately, the book is too short to be of much use as anything but a checklist for people trying to reengineer organizations. At least it's good for that.As far as the personal stories gleaned from years of purchasing experience are concerned, I could only find two, which collectively took up a whopping half a page. I'm not suggesting that the author didn't rely on his extensive experience to write the book, but he principally just states the ""facts"" as he sees them, and provides precious few examples to illustrate his points. More vexing still, is that the man probably could have taught his readers a great deal about purchasing, but chose to write about other things instead. I've little doubt that there are people out there who can greatly benefit from this book, but they probably number in the thousands, which is probably why it's called ""Common Sense Purchasing"" and not ""Common Sense Modernization of a Purchasing Organization""."

While it is decidedly NOT the best book ever it does have its moments.The story involves a scheming pair of former lovers sharing their designs on capturing and destroying hearts of innocents around them. I can see when this book was written over two hundred years ago it caused a great scandal. While not explicit in language it leaves little doubt as to what is transpiring. Just when our nasty duo get close to capturing their prey everything unravels in an unexpected way (..no spoilers here).Since the story is told in a sequence of over one hundred letters between the characters I'd imagine most folks would find this format to be a major turn-off. Admittedly the first half of the book is a bit tedious. However the second half is quite engrossing, making this book well worth the effort.Bottom line: a unique book worthy of its reputation.

B000QU9S3O,Ramona,,AOKGRSAS5VNS3,"Lydia ""The Lost Entwife""",0/0,4.0,1337299200,Review of Ramona,"Sometimes I wonder if there's a point to reviewing older novels. I mean - there's obviously a point to reading them, and Ramona presents a good case for that. But after reading a book like this it's hard to imagine that others haven't read it, or something like it... until I remember that until this past semester, I'd never even heard of Ramona.For those of you who, like me, had never thought to pick this book up let me just say that it will frustrate, awe, and inspire you. The story is one that speaks of epic, sweeping love and loss, but it's buried in pages upon pages of description which, back in the day before the internet, television, and radio, would have passed for entertainment but today just feels as if it's one more thing to push through in order to get to the meat of the story.Thankfully, I read this book for a classroom setting - so three days were set aside for us to get to the meat and actually talk about the themes and ideas in Ramona.Here's what I came away from this talks with:Even in a story, such as Ramona, when the author is seeking to shed light on the issues of the time (specifically the tensions between whites, Mexicans, and Native Americans), in order for Ramona to be related to she is given ""white"" characteristics - i.e. blue eyes from her Scottish Father.Sweeping stereotypes are made not only about the whites (and honestly, as far as stereotypes go, they were pretty harsh but necessary ones) but also about Mexicans. Even the Native Americans in this book did not escape judgement from Helen Hunt Jackson.Jackson has no problem spending 70 pages talking about the little things - making a bed on a porch, tension-filled relationship between Ramona and her adoptive family, and so on.. but she spends less than a paragraph on a vital turning part of the story. In fact, the action and result of this turning part happened so quickly I thought I'd imagined it happening and had to go back to re-read it.I understand from our discussions the importance of a book like Ramona and I believe that it's important that it continues to be read and talked about - but more than anything, I wonder how that will be possible with the changing of our culture. We talk in 140 character tweets - so how can we expect young adults today to be patient enough to read pages upon pages of description? It saddens me to think that this story is one of many that will end up lost as a result - so if you decide to read just one ""classic"" American story this year, think about choosing this one."

Given that the MacBride family inherited the hugely successful and profitable ""Little House"" franchise from Rose, it's a shame that they've passed off this fictional account not once, but TWICE, as a true depiction of Rose's life as a young woman.While the essentials and facts are mostly true, anyone who has read or researched Rose's life knows that Rose and Paul Cooley were never ""engaged"". And Gilette Lane was not the ""dashing older man"" portrayed in the books. In fact, he was one year younger than Rose! Evidence supports that they met while Rose was working in Kansas City and her subsequent move to San Francisco was likely to follow him there, marrying him the next year, BEFORE they sold real estate together.My disgust with this book really lies in the fact that the owners of the Little House franchise (the MacBride heirs) should have shown more respect for both Rose and the fans of the series and ended the Rose years with a more accurate and honest portrayal of their benefactress.The spunky characterization of Rose from the earlier books is gone here, and we're left feeling concerned about her choices and future.

The fact that it was out of print and expensive even as a Black Lizard paperback reissue upped my expectations even more.But I became disappointed with it very quickly. The prose is remarkably sharp and truncated, yes, but also lacks almost all descriptive detail and consistently focuses only on dialogue. Often it reads like a screenplay. The pacing of the novel is just plain manic-- in the thirties this must have seemed exciting and original, but now that MTV style jump-cut editing has proliferated and influenced all mediums, sheer speed seems cliche. This novel is ""noir"" in the traditional sense of the word: gangsters and stupid dames and violence that never seems to hurt the protagonist... ho hum.There's hardly any social commentary, either. Although this novel does seem to be a sort of Magnetic North for traditional American crime fiction, I have to say I found it difficult to get through and somewhat mediocre."

This is especially true in Chapter 7, where he discusses the major thinkers of 19th century Germany without once citing an original source or showing much understanding of those he addresses.

Classical Judaism in Glazer's coneption stands 'first of all for Torah, for learning which is more than for knowledge but rather a ' bridge between the human and the divine'. Classical Judaism in the relations between people requires more than justice, it requires 'hesed, acts of loyalty, mercy , loving concern , a spirit of renunciation and conciliation. Classical Judaism requires help for and consideration of the poor. It requires the living by Hillel's great law of ' what is hateful to you do not do to another'. Classical Judaism as Glazer defines it welcomes proselytes, has a loving spirit to mankind, is critical of militarism, and power- politics, and also the deterioration morally of the traditional priesthood. Glazer claims that Hillel's Judaism is close to the common man and his needs.This is an excellent small study that bases itself on the Mishnaic sources, especially on Avot."

I disagree with reviewers who say the Bush campaign was behind this book. If you read the book, it says in the last chapter that ""no funding or direction had been asked for or received from the Republican National Committee or the Bush Cheney campaign."" This book convinced me not to vote for Kerry."

Well in Mr. Durrell's book based on his experiences living on a tiny island in Greece, you get all this and more. &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; is a delightful and amusing book that you just can't put down. In his book Gerald, as the naturalist wannabe in his younger days, stuffs spiders in his older brother's matchbox( you can imagine what happens when he tries to smoke)and scares his mother out of her mind with the exotic animals he brings home. He even ends up having a 'zoo' in his attic complete with snakes, owls, lizards and the occasional magpie. In conclusion, if your looking an amusing book to read that will also make you quite the intellectual (people dig others who are knowledgable about animals) than &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; by Gerald Durrell is the book you want."

B000PC1106,The Beanstalk and Beyond: Developing Critical Thinking Through Fairy Tales,,A3OB5ZNMHB0DRM,"Stephanie M. Green ""Stephanie Green""",9/9,5.0,1205971200,An outstanding teacher/librarian resource,"The Beanstalk and Beyond: Developing Critical Thinking Through Fairy TalesJoan M. Wolf has created a tool that will make learning with fairytales memorable for children of all ages and abilities. In her introduction she states ""...this book is not just about the study of fairy tales. It is about experiencing the joys of creative writing and creative problem solving with students"" The items needed to implement the lessons are basic things that can be found in every classroom which keeps teachers from having to spend more money on the supplies. In the copyright notice it does say that a library media specialist or teacher can photocopy from this book as long as it is used for one single school. The notice also states that portions of the book (up to 15 pages) can be used for professional development in a single school. This book is a great addition to any professional collection of a library or classroom. While reading I found activities for my library, for teacher's classroom use, and for our gifted teachers. This book is user friendly and an easy read for anyone that wants to increase higher order thinking in their instruction.Chapter 1 is designed to get students excited about writing and studying fairy tales. This chapter is full of thought provoking questions like, ""What do enchanted trees look like? Are they gentle-looking or fierce looking? What colors are their bark and leaves? What do they feel like to the touch? Do they have any kind of smell?"" (p.10). That is just one of many discussion starters or journal prompts. There are two activities in this chapter that I absolutely love. One is a graffiti wall in which you post a question and students are invited to respond in graffiti style on the butcher paper wall. I am currently using this at my school in a man hallway and I have children of all ages (k-5) responding. The other activity has you placing a question about a fairy tale on each student's back. The students walk around and have people answer their question and the have to guess what the question is. Both activities get students involved and excited about fairy tales while they think critically and improve their question and answer skills.Chapter 2 takes a critical looks at characterization while allowing children to manipulate characters from a fairy tale. Students will change information about the character and then create resumes, employment ads, business cards, and even advice columns. At the end of the chapter students will even create their own fairy tale character after being asked a series of questions to get them thinking in the right direction. I couldn't help but think about how this could change our student's view of creative writing and problem solving.Chapter 3 works on the perspective and point of view of a story. Students will be asked to create talk shows, advertisements, news broadcasts, and persuasive speeches to prove that the villain in the fairy tale is actually innocent. I love this chapter because students are always fond of remakes of fairy tales where the villain tells their side of the story. This chapter helps students see that they can do their own remakes of fairy tales. I would love to create a school newspaper after studying fairy tales and fill it with the various remakes of the classic fairy tales. I think students would be so proud of their work.Chapter 4 is all about developing creative story skills while making up their own fairy tales. This really focuses on how to create fractured fairy tales by just changing a few things in the original story. It also discusses creating a fairy tale by starting at the end of a story and working to the beginning.I think Joan M. Wolf has created a dynamic resource for anyone that works with children. Examples of products are throughout the book so that anyone can easily teach these lessons and provide examples to learners. This could be used in book clubs about fairy tales, in public library summer reading programs, and any classroom in any part of the world. This is a must have for anyone who wants to increase critical thinking, creative writing, and questioning skills. The only thing I would have liked to see added to this book is basic rubrics for evaluating products. Most of the products created could not easily be graded and every teacher will want to put a grade on the hard work their students will do. A basic rubric for each product would have been a nice touch to help teachers save time. I think a CD of rubrics would have been even better so that teachers could easily go in and manipulate the basic rubric to meet their needs. Overall, this is an outstanding resource and worth every penny to purchase multiple copies."

At times I had to force myself to read this. The plot is written from the perspectives of a couple: Inman and Ada. Inman gets fed up with all of the death he is exposed to while fighting in the Civil War and embarks on an odyssey to go home while being wounded in the neck. Ada struggles to care for a large estate of land that she inherits from her father while at the same time becoming increasingly tired of the life she leads. Some of the situations described in the book are powerful and memorable, but truth be told, I finished this book three days ago and already forgot most of it."

The book ""Little Women"" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic. However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition. Just a heads up for anyone considering this Barnes and Noble edition."
B00085ZGFG,Crime & punishment;,,A2Q3ZGG9NUY0H9,Aged to Perfection,3/5,5.0,1125619200,Love the Book! (But is the translation any good?),"I'm 4/5 the way through this book, and haven't been able to put it down. It's a page turner. I agree with all the wonderful positive things stated prior to my review, but I have to point out that I find the translation confusing, or sloppy. (Not that I could do any better). But here's my points:* Some characters seem to have alternative names. For example, In one moment, you may see a character referred to as ""Luzhin"", and later as ""Pytor Petrovitch"". (Page 151 and other places) This doesn't happen in conversation with other characters which might make some sense, but from the third person narrative. There are, I think, at least two other characters I encountered with the ""alternative name"" issue. In addition, there is an easy one : ""Sonia"" vs ""Sofya"". Unless you happen to know that Sonia is familiar for Sofya, you might be lost for a bit.EDIT: Finally, at page 376 I saw ""Pytor Petrovitch Luzhin"", which identified this characters full name, at last.* Some completely different and unrelated characters have the same last name! This led to a lot of confusion too. Katerina Ivanovna is the name of a ill woman, Alyona Ivanovna is the murdered pawnbroker, Amalia Ivanovna is Katerina's landlady. Amalia Ivanovna also is referred to by the author as Ludwignovna.There is another, too, I believe.Where does this confusion come from? Is it me? or the author? or the translator? Did I miss some familial connection between all those Ivanovna's?; or does this name reoccur with that kind of frequency in Russia? Or was the translator sloppy? EDIT: Could ""Ivanovna"" be some kind of commonly used address?* During an interview between the Hero, and the detective, (and this scene and so many others are terrific btw!) the detective seems to have a nervous laugh which comes out as ""he-he-he""--- a lot. Annoying as such a laugh is, it's forgivable and not really disconcerting because I just figured this character has a nervous little silly laugh. However, later on, the stern, mean old Luzhin who has never laughed until this late point in the book has a conversation wherein he laughs several times. ""he-he-he"". Is ""he-he-he"" a good translation of whatever Doestoevsky used to denote laughing? If not, then the translator has maligned the characters by giving them a ridiculous laugh.But I am VERY impressed with the book. The characters are indeed 3d, as has been said. They all seem real to me. The suspense is wonderful. The several story lines going on at once is well done! Multi-faceted story and multi-faceted characters. I love this book, because I never know where it's going to. At one point, I said, ""aha! Luzhin's probably going to try to kill Raskolnikov. Now I'll watch that unfold!"" and something else totally happened, which was even better. Of course, he may yet! (I've only read 4/5ths so far, you know.)If you're in the mood for this book--i highly recommend it."

B0002X7W7E,The Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works,,A2P49WD75WHAG5,Daniel J. Hamlow,18/20,5.0,1070668800,Scientific explanations for all things Harry Potter,"The initial quote from Clarke's Law, that the highest form of technology is indistinguishable from magic sets the basis for this book. And in reading the Harry Potter books and watching the movies, one can't help but wonder, how does that work in the world of Hogwarts? The bottom line is that the world of Hogwarts has got a technology that far surpasses 21st century technology, so to us, it does appear like magic. Think of what the Aztecs thought when Cortes and his men fired their guns. Surely they thought the guns were magic, as that was alien to their civilization.The Science Of Harry Potter is the name of this book. What science, you might ask? Well, how about alchemy, astronomy, biology, genetics, physiology, quantum physics, time travel, And there's some more, like history and mythology, on where creatures like Fluffy the three-headed dog guarding the Sorcerer's Stone and games like Quidditch were based on. He also incorporates work from Einstein, Rutherford, Hawking, B.F. Skinner, John Nash (A Beautiful Mind) and Kip Thorne from the Muggle side.The Sorting Hat, which sent the first-year Hogwarts students into their respective houses, might have had some interface that interpreted brain waves from the students, but there's also the concept of recognizing personalities a la Jung or Keirsey, so I wonder if the Hat's technology can correlate the brain's wiring with that of a Guardian, Rational, Idealist, or Artisan, to use Keirsey's classifications, and then say ""Gryffindor"" or ""Slytherin.""The theory of time travel in the Muggle world is that one can't go back in time before the machine was built, and also to prevent a mistaken killing of one's ancestors, because then one would be erased from existence. Hogwarts technicians must've overcome that glitch. Hey, if it's possible in Dr. Who, why not in Harry Potter?However, the fact that Nicolas Flamel is based on a real life 14th century alchemist and that Queen Elizabeth I's conjurer John Dee was the inspiration for Albus Dumbledore will jerk some eyes open.As for an example of a psychological aspect of Harry Potter, Highfield uses bereavement syndrome to explain the Mirror of Erised, with the mirror as an output device that's receptive to the brain's trauma-ridden visions.Apart from using J.K. Rowling's first four books, Roger Highfield exhaustively used respected biology, psychology, physics, and medical journals, and history books as his sources.If one is of a highly fantastical and romantic nature, not wanting to spoil the magic of Harry Potter by possible scientific explanations, go elsewhere. Those who are able to accept Clarke's Law and assimilate these theories into the Harry Potter universe without it spoiling the magic, this book's for you. Well, time to put on my silvery cross-connected fiber-optic cape that records images from the background over me. See ya."

Central to the work are Spirit, faith, hope, and love, the final components of each section.As one would expect, central elements of Barthian theology are present. The Word of God and the community of faith are central to the theological endeavor. God is the ultimate object of theology, rather than humanity.This is an excellent introduction to Barth.

The book predates the first coming of Jesus Christ by about 100 years and continues on. You can even use this book in conjunction with the ""Works of Josephus"" another biblical historical writting that begins ealier and provides different points of historical value than that of the book ""Jesus the Messiah"".One thing that I looked for when purchasing the book was the reliability of the seller and the condition of the book since it was used.

The problem for me is that he is as much a criminal as they are, but his criminality is glossed over against their greater violence, a common theme in literature. Randle McMurphy, to me, is not a sympathetic figure, but he is made to look that way because his ""freedom"" comes through attempts to defy an extremely oppressive power structure. Indeed it is mentioned that he once led an escape from a Chinese prison camp...but his behavior is still very much thieving and unexemplary. Among many other things, his stautory rape of a yong teenage girl is decidedly glossed over; but for me that one act robs his character of much of its sympathy.If you want a book that purports to be an expose' of mental hospitals in the mid-twentieth century, without a single redeeming quality, (personally I cannot and will not believe that all of them were such hell-holes) then this book is for you. I'm reading it because, again, it is very well written, and since I am in a production of it on the stage as my very first drama, I want to do my job thoroughly, and that's why I am reading it. Great reading, but for God's sake don't read it when you're depressed."

1578152437,Oliver Twist (Classics Collection),,A3TKGM2JJJC1I3,"Jennifer B. Barton ""Beth Barton""",1/1,4.0,1078185600,"Biting Social Commentary, Pretty Good Story","Starting with Oliver's premature birth to a dying mother looked on by a gin-swilling nurse in a parish workhouse, Dickens tone is extremely satirical. Though his meanings are clear, his craftsmanship with the English language is in rare form in the beginning of Oliver Twist. The ""distinguished and enlightened gentlemen"" who's reform policies for the workhouse are raked over the coals in glowing language represent an unusual type of Dickens character for me. Usually even Dicken's villains are multi-faceted characters whose motives we understand though disapprove of. Here, the Directors of the parish who eventually pay to get rid of Oliver, are difficult to conceive of. The hardships of the workhouse inmates, more especially what seems like intentional starvation, seem hard to believe though as I read this book, the death of a foster child in New Jersey from starvation brought to light many things going on in twenty-first century reality which had seemed implausible in this nineteenth century novel. The satirical language is often humorous though the subject matter is not and makes the account more palatable. The first of the book is spent in this way which seems really to be more of Dicken's social commentary than pure story line.In true Dickens style, each of the characters Oliver meets throughout the story are part of a larger, more elaborate plot line that the story is ever trying to unfold. After being apprenticed to the coffinmaker Mr. Sowerberry, he is taunted by the charity boy - Noah Claypole - until he makes a break for London. Accidentally falling into the clutches of local fence Fagin whose aim it is to turn him to a life of crime, Oliver struggles to break free with the help of various good hearted people he befriends along the way despite his situation. It is only through their help who believe in him against all odds that we find that Fagin's attempts to make Oliver into a thief or at least believe that he has broken the law is not entirely the result of chance. As a shadowy figure going by the name of Monks attempts to remove proofs of Oliver's origins, it is up to his new friends to piece together the puzzle of Oliver's life and help him to break free once and for all from the poverty of his existence.Until Oliver's friends get involved, I wasn't entirely grabbed by the story line but I don't know if that was from my inability to connect with the workhouse characters or my familiarity with the early part of the story. Once they got involved and I was into a part of the story I knew nothing about, I did really get into it. Like A Tale of Two Cities, I would say that this one starts a little slow but takes off towards the middle. Unlike that novel, however, its lacks the profound nobility, with some characters having little value except as a vehicle in the commentary (like Mr. Bumble). The Tale of Two Cities was not an out and out social commentary (it was hidden well within the folds of the pages) but I would have to say that Twist is. It is a good story, well worth reading, but its lasting value is not in the character of the orphan Oliver - it is in the passion of the author against the wrongs of the then welfare system. It seems more to me to be a moralism: a tale to remind us of ourselves and to guard against the mistakes of the past and to ensure the lives of the vulnerable in the future."

B000N6DGFC,The Scarlet Letter A Romance,,A1YE1GIKUPBX3F,Rebecca,0/0,4.0,1346716800,So Often Misunderstood,"*Spoiler Alert*I really enjoyed this book. At age 41, I decided it was about time I read ""the book"" I somehow avoided reading in high school. It is interesting to find that it represented something entirely different from what I believed. This is not a social commentary on single parenthood or adultery. Rather, it is a comparison of choices and their effects.Regardless of who we are, each of us has something we believe in. We don't have to share the values of others to see how their beliefs drive the consequences of their choices. We can learn from them, even if we don't agree with them.This story contrasts the choices made by the three main characters: Hester Prynne, Reverend Arthur Dimmsdale, and Roger Chillingworth. Each sin against his/her own puritanical beliefs then make choices that profoundly affect their lives.Hester has an adulterous affair with another man. With the birth of her child and an absentee husband, her sin is laid bare for everyone to see. As punishment, a scarlet ""A"" is fashioned that she is always to wear upon the breast of her gown. This letter was to represent the stigma of her crime and compel others to treat her as an outcast. Hester lives her life and never stops trying to atone for her sins. In fact, near the end of the book we find that others have started to look upon the ""A"" with another meaning, ""able."" She tended the sick, gave assistance to the poor, and offered comfort and relief to souls on their death bed. The ""A"" became as Mr. Hawthorne said, ""the symbol of her calling."" (p183) Once rejected and ridiculed, she was now a respected member of her society. Hester, openly, took responsibility for her actions and never again sinned against her beliefs. She found true healing to her soul through service and compassion of her fellowmen.Reverend Arthur Dimmsdale, Hester's pastor, is compelled to pass judgment on her soul. In addition, he is called upon to persuade Hester to give up the name of her fellow-sinner. From his words to her, it is obvious that he is the guilty party. His words, coming from the depths of his soul, confess his part in her sin. He, in effect, is begging her to help him out of his cowardice to stand, once again, in the light. He says, ""Take heed how thou deniest to him--who, perchance, hath not the courage to grasp it for himself--the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now presented to thy lips!"" (p77) After Hester refuses to speak his name, he makes the decision to secretly retain his guilt and gives his soul over to darkness. In the seven years that Hester transforms into a respected member of society, Arthur's guilt causes him to physically become very fragile and weak. In the end, though he finally frees himself from the burden and reveals his secret, he dies. He throws away everything he believes in, and preaches about, to dishonesty, cowardice and fear.Roger Chillingworth, the absentee husband of Hester, shows up the very day she is publically shamed in front of the community. She sees him, while she stands publicly humiliated on the scaffold. Mr. Chillingworth is an old man and admits to Hester that marrying her was wrong. He does not condemn her for her transgression saying, ""Between thee and me, the scale hangs fairly balanced. But Hester, the man lives who has wronged us both! Who is he?"" (p85) When she refuses to tell who he is, Roger promises her that he will find out. In addition, he demands that she tell no one of his true identity as her husband. She agrees. Thus, Roger sets in motion his plan of revenge. He recognizes that the pastor is gravely ill and moves in with him. As he investigates he is certain that Reverend Dimmsdale's illness is connected to Hester. He learns the truth one day when the pastor is sleeping. He discovers the ""A"" burned onto his chest. With satisfaction, he turns his plans for revenge directly on the pastor. As he comes to his greatest moment of triumph, he is robbed of it when the pastor confesses publicly his sin. Kneeling on the scaffolding, with the Reverend close to death he says, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" For seven years Roger's life has been consumed with revenge; after being robbed of it, he dies within the year. Hatred and revenge steal the life he could have known.The purpose of Hawthorne's text is to show that we become a product of our choices--choices governed by our own beliefs. No matter what those beliefs, if we violate their laws, the consequences will be profound. Our strength of character will shine through as we respond to the consequences of our actions. Through those responses we have the potential of gaining or losing many things, including: our self-respect, our reputations, our souls, and even our lives. In short, how we respond to unfavorable consequences will make us stronger or eventually destroy us."

My brother who is 10) read this book and loved it, absolutly loved it. However I was slightly skeptical going into it, afraid that it was too ""kiddyish"" for my tastes. I'm happy to say that this book changed my mind, which is no easy task... I went into the book not liking it, and by the end I loved it... Not many books can do that for me. It is as fine a peice of fiction as any I've read, the story is thourghouly devoloped however incomplete) and totaly realized.I think what alot of people forget is that it's *fiction*, I read one review of The Subtle Knife which, by the way, I liked *even better* than The Golden Compass) that condemned it as ""devil worship"", now I can only look at that review and laugh to myself. Yes, Pullman did make very deffinite statements about god and religion but it's a peice of *FICTION*, it's *NOT REAL*, and his statements can hardly be construed as devil worship. If you're offended by it, then don't read it... but don't then condemn other people for reading it and enjoying it... I think most people can accept this book as a work of fantasy and not reality.I cannot make you read this book, but I can highly recommend it, like I said before, it changed my opinion of it, simply by being as good as it is. It is *strikeingly* original, I've never read anything quite like it. I hold this series in the same respect as Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere, and Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind. All three are very original works of *art*, I can't recommend Pullman's series (nor the others for that matter) enough.P>S> I'm always up for a good book discussion."

First, Lovins' book (in the Executive Summary) says that we can again ""make natural gas abundant and affordable..."". This is an absurd statement and doesn't even deserve more of a response.Secondly, within the next ten years or LESS, the world will have consumed an additional amount of oil, EQUAL TO the ENTIRE proven, recoverable reserves of Saudi Arabia, and Arabia has for years been considered the world's swing producer!Finally, Lovins' dreams of building millions and millions of ultra light-weight vehicles are just that, DREAMS! The remaining world supply of crude oil and natural gas are simply not great enough to bootstrap our efforts to create a new, pervasive light-weight transportation fleet, even if government and private industry had the money to capitalize the effort. And what exactly would we DO with the billion or more ""inefficient"" vehicles that exist in the world now?As for bio-fuels, and other alternatives, there is no way they will or can provide anything close to the future energy-density that the world needs. Furthermore, growing ""bio"" fuels requires massive amounts of crude oil (for fertilizer, pesticides, processing, not to mention the vehicles needed to harvest and transport these crops, plus the energy required to pump the water to irrigate them).Just read Kunstler's book, and Heinberg's books...the party IS over...."

Supposedly a distant relative of the respectable Lady Ashton, Louisa stays invisible by being dowdy--and serves as an investigative reporter, reporting on scandals in 'society' in Victorian England. She's hot on the trail of a rumor that a respected gentleman is actually part owner of a notorious brothel when she runs into someone else investigating--a man who just might be a jewel thief. She and Anthony Stalbridge form an alliance--they'll pool their knowledge to learn the secrets that both of them need.What starts out as strictly a business arrangement takes a turn toward the sensual when Louisa and Anthony are forced to rely on an ancient device to escape detection--they pretend to be lovers, kissing. But pretend kissing has a way of turning into real kissing. Unfortunately, Louisa has a secret that she knows will ever keep her from finding love and marriage--and everyone knows an illicit relationship can only lead to an unhappy ending.Although Louisa is certain their relationship is doomed, the investigation goes well. Louisa's evidence is only the beginning of the evils Mr. Hastings has undertaken. He's certainly conducting blackmail. Could he also be guilty of murder--including, perhaps, the murder of Anthony's ex-fiancee?Author Amanda Quick writes an engaging story with a light touch. Neither Louisa nor Anthony is a particularly complicated character, but their clever dialogue, the cute misunderstandings, and a nice mystery with just enough twists to keep the reader involved add up to an enjoyable novel. THE RIVER KNOWS is summer-beach reading, but it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that and we all need a nice desert from time to time."

Mrs. Lancaster has also been mysteriously whisked away from the nursing home by relatives who left no forwarding address.A rowboat added to the painting by someone other than the artist, a nursing home murder, a grave with no body, and a letter in a secret compartment are some of the clues that lead to the uncovering of crimes both old and new.This is on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement from a master storyteller and you probably will want to read it all in one sitting.

B000GLJG76,Watership Down,,A1CTHS95BKTEQO,"Susan B. Evans ""The Story Lady""",2/2,5.0,1262908800,Watership Down: A Magical Masterpiece,"Watership Down is the story of a small group of rabbits traveling across the English countryside in search of a new home. Their tale begins when Fiver, a small, nervous rabbit, senses an unnamed future danger for the warren in which they live. Fiver has the gift of prophecy, and when he speaks, his older brother Hazel listens. After taking their concerns to the Chief Rabbit and trying in vain to make him believe and understand that they are in great danger, Hazel and Fiver plan an escape from their warren. The brothers, along with a group of like-minded individuals, leave the warren and go through several adventures in search of a safe place to live.To give anymore of the plot details away would remove some of the enchantment from this incredible book, and I refuse to do that to you. Watership Down is a story of great beauty. As I have stated before, it is my all-time favorite book. I first read it when I was just 12 years old, almost 20 years ago. I have read many other wonderful books over the years, but there is something special about Watership Down, a certain magic that not even time can erase. I have read it many times, and have vowed beginning this year to re-read as my first book of each new year from now on. You may say that life is too short to re-read books, but I say that life is to short not to enjoy your favorite things.Richard Adams began Watership Down as a story told aloud to his two daughters on a long car trip. In creating his fantastic world of wild rabbits, Adams constructed a new language, a complete culture, and an imaginative folk history for his characters, all of which add incredible depth to the story and to the characters themselves. The rabbits of Watership Down act with human characteristics such as bravery, loyalty and ingenuity. However Adams has written them with a naturalist's eye for real rabbits - the reader is left with the impression that this is simply how rabbits behave.Watership Down is a marvelous tale of adventure, the breathtaking story of a journey which leads eventually to the safety of a new home, as well as a keen understanding of the outside world and all its perils. If you'll allow yourself to get lost in the story, you will not regret it. Rich in detail and with a compelling and entertaining plot, Watership Down is truly a timeless masterpiece, a modern day classic that is beloved by many (including myself - in case I have not made that clear.)"

The doctrine under their observation seen in its whole, and represented in its wholesome truth, is correlative to the essential oxygen coursing through our bloodstream. This challenging look at how the body is comprised and ought to exist in union with Christ and in subsequent union with true believers, is irreplaceable as teaching material for example, for small groups, for the effective practice of biblical norms insisted on by our Christ and Lord - yet often neglected wholesale. This is not looking out for Nr 1 but the almost inconceivable reaching out to all the beloved in Christ.'Union in Christ is the basis for the communion of the saints.' p 27The honorable Judge Martin's contribution, 'Gifts And Graces', is one I would like to highlight. It is by no means a deep theological foray, but is forceful and august in its simplicity and forthrightness. 'The church proclaims and teaches the Bible. All of its evangelizing, preaching, teaching, worshiping, counseling and serving are directed by the infallible Word of God. The saints are gathered by the proclamation of God's Word, and then they are perfected by putting into practice its teaching.' p 45 It contains just enough historical consciousness to convince the reader that we are indeed continuing in the footsteps of the historical church of Christ.'Our gifts are entrusted to us by grace, and our graces equip us to exercise our gifts. Christ gives spiritual gifts and graces to adorn and equip the church for the work it is called to do.' p 100'In the early church spiritual gifts included miracles such as the ability to cast out evil spirits, speaking in unknown tongues, supernatural healing, and even raising the dead back to life. These extraordinary gifts were given to edify the church by confirming the truth of the apostolic gospel (1 Cor 14:26; Heb 2:4). The gifts given to the early church also included extraordinary callings such as apostle and prophet (Eph 4:11; 1 Cor 12:28).' p 102'We need to be careful not to condemn those whom God accepts. Unless a doctrinal mistake concerns an essential element of the Christian faith or a person's misconduct is scandalous (1 Cor 5:11), we should not exclude a fellow pilgrim from our fellowship. Since God wants us to live in harmony in the church, we must accept some whom we believe to be in error. This causes weak Christians difficulty because they think it requires compromise, which many view as the worst sin of all. However, accepting the gifts and graces of a brother or sister who is in error does not constitute compromise, nor does it require that we change our views. The Scripture commands us to 'accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters' Rom 14:1.' p 105'Not every doctrinal error is heresy. Furthermore, not every member of the church that tolerates heresy necessarily believes its damnable doctrines. Nevertheless, we should not be surprised to encounter heresy in the church. God sometimes allows a heresy to develop in order to plainly segregate truth from error. But we need to guard ourselves and others from falling into heresy and thereby falling into ruin.' p 105'The invisible church is 'the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head' (The Westminster Confession of Faith25.1). In other words, the invisible church consists of all true believers, not just those who say they are Christians.' p 5"

In the novel the creature has yellow eyes, tightly drawn skin, long black hair, is very agile, and is highly intelligent. The creature is hyper intelligent. Within minutes of his creation he figured out how to dress himself and only months after that he could speak, read and write, more articulately than his own creator. He was even quoting Milton. Many people remember the moral not to play God but few remember that there is a secondary moral. The creature had to forgive his creator for how he treated him, for abandoning him, and for not preparing him for the cruelties of the world. He had to learn that revenge would bring him no peace but only perpetuate a cycle of anger and revenge.There is also the message of responsibility to one's child and the importance of keeping one's promises (which Victor breaks several times in the course of the story and only causes more trouble for everyone invovled).The creature is tragic. This is a brilliant work of literature by a impressively creative woman. What she created was a story that will last through the ages, a combination of science, alchemy and parent / child metaphors that reaches us on a very basic level. Read the classic novel if you have not yet done so already."

I hope someone finds this helpful in their decision to purchase these books. :)This is a wonderful series for children (and adults) who value learning through literature--especially classic literature. What makes it even more appealing to parents and educators is the way the publishers have integrated historically relevant facts with the complete, unabridged text. Each classic branches over several areas of learning--history, culture, geography, customs, animal life, architecture, literature, and science.The Call of the Wild includes sidebars, maps, photographs, line drawings, diagrams, and paintings describing the Gold Rush, Klondike region, transcontinental railroad, sledding, traveling routes, harsh conditions, animal life, tools and procedures used for mining gold, and more.The Jungle Book provides details about India, animal life, religious landmarks and architecture, culture and customs. It also includes two-page features on wolf children, the seal massacre, and a photo spread of India.Around the World in Eighty Days takes the reader across a geographical journey using various forms of transportation. Maps, illustrations, and photographs provide rich detail into the culture and landmarks of many different locales and the means of transportation used in each leg of the journey.Treasure Island provides abundant information on ocean-related topics--sailors, pirates, treasure chests, ocean voyages, living conditions, crimes and punishment, weaponry, traditions, slavery, animal and plant life, medicine and disease, and more. It includes two- or three-page spreads featuring ocean charts, navigational instruments, compasses, types of ships, a cut-out diagram of a ship's compartments, sails, rigging, ropework, points of sail, and famous pirates.These books inspire an integrated approach to learning and would make a wonderful addition to your home library."

B000HLFD4K,The Great Gatsby,,A8CUUNCFCVJD5,RIKKI,1/1,4.0,1083196800,THE GREAT GATSBY IS A GREAT BOOK!!!!,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a great novel! I would first like to tell you that upon my first reading of the novel I was not impressed. My first reading of the novel was when I was a freshman in high school. I didn't enjoy reading nor did I appreciate writing at that time. My disliking of reading contributed and affected my views on the book drastically. I decided to give the book another try again seven years later and I love it! I think if the book is read by an experienced reader at any age, then one could appreciate the book for the many great aspects and details provided for the readers.This novel brings to us many feelings. It demonstrates to us how greed, wealth, love, ambition, success, lover's triangles, and one's desire can change life. Once all those things are linked together the plot becomes very intense. I enjoyed that the novel included all of those life's happenings.The plot to the novel is very exciting. It portrays the early 1900's and the Jazz Age beautifully. I enjoyed that the plot was directed towards what daily life could bring to one's self. The characters, plot, daily occurrences, opportunities, employment, and the struggles in the book were all a very good representation of early American life. I feel the book portrayed real life, real problems, and real people. While reading the book I never thought or found what I was reading to be far fetched.I enjoyed that the book was told by a character that wasn't the main character. I enjoyed the perspective that it gave by looking into Gatsby's life and not Gatsby simply being informative about his life story. I also enjoyed that the main characters were not the only focus in the book! There were additional characters that were linked in many different ways to the main ones and were introduced and then continuously followed upon. The book became to be a story about many people and how life`s obstacles affected their decisions, choices, and life in general.I think anyone who enjoys reading should read this novel at least once. The novel has a very nice story line that I think most everyone should enjoy it! I give this book 4 stars!!!!"

Jeremy was good-looking and charasmatic and very arrogant. He wanted money for his high life-style of traveling, light drug use, dressing well, lots of girlfriends, etc. and apparently didn't want to wait for his parents (adoptive parents, at that) to die, or to share any inheritance with his sister (who was also adopted). I don't want to give away anymore of the story, but even knowing these details going in, it is so well written and there are so many interesting characters, I read this book quickly and hated to see it end. The biological parentage of Jeremy will surprise eveyone not familiar with this tale of horror in Britian. I am hoping the author has written more books of this sort, because she was very thorough and unbiased. If you like true crime, this one is a keeper!"

Hamilton oeuvre. If you want action, very little character development, and a quick & easy read then this book is NOT for you.However, if you, like me, enjoy reading novels that require a brain--that happen to incorporate fantasy elements, real intelligent characters with actual thoughts, then you will love Robin McKinley.Those of you who have read RM's books before, will realize that what she does is wonderful and unique. Her books will last. They will be treasured and re-read for years. (For instance, look how long ""Beauty"" has been in print).I wish this book was longer, contained more ""talk"" and more of Sunshine's unique world. I was disappointed when it ended and to hear that there would not be a sequel.Robin McKinley is one of the best fantasy authors out there and I am disappointed that she has written so few novels. Every one is a jewel! I hope this will not be her last."

S. Lewis,"The Screwtape Letters is Lewis's classic collection of diabolical correspondence. In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking. Most every reader will find elements in it to which he or she can relate. Christians of all maturity levels can benefit from this book.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

The author, however, in my estimation, takes on too much in one bite, and her critique of the culture, while it strikes true, leaves a bitter after taste...there is no redemption or goodness that one can draw upon in the end. The novel left me feeling that things were hopeless. It is true that the very power of the novel lies in the devastating criticism of a society mired in senseless tradition, but I was left with the feeling that the author used every tool at hand to shock and disgust rather than understand."

He tells his tale in detail.I grew up on the Rod Taylor /George Pal movie. When I started the book I expected it to be slightly different with a tad more complexity as with most book/movie relationships. I was surprised to find the reason for the breakup of species (Morlock and Eloi) was class Vs atomic (in later movie versions it was political). I could live with that but to find that some little pink thing replaced Yvette Mimieux was too munch.After all the surprises we can look at the story as unique in its time, first published in 1895, yet the message is timeless. The writing and timing could not have been better. And the ending was certainly appropriate for the world that he describes. Possibly if the story were written today the species division would be based on eugenics.The Time Machine Starring: Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux"

Having fun for example is one of the many things we do well. He quite frankly has too many things clouding his mind. Glazov could be correct in saying that the cause becomes more important than the individual( or somthing of that nature ) when a lefty engages in a certain belief. Yes okay I can side with him, after all what is more impressive than somebody sacrificing ones own self for the common good. I would guess that glazov is a very lonly character with not much else to do but critize others who are trying to make a difference in this crazy , cold , and imperfect world . It took me all but ten minutes to figure this Glazov out. All my life I've been fighting people like Glazov off and as stubborn as they are I keep believing that I could change their one track selfish minds, it will happen in time I have faith in eutopia. It is refreshing to read reviews by other intellectual leftists keep up the good work. yeah chomsky. This Glazov really needs some friends to chat with , get his satire 15 Tips on how to be a good leftist and please write a review explaning to him how imperative it is to have a strong belief in humanity. I am counting on all my submissive comrades( in other words my non-violent fellow leftists ) to help me on my stanse against leftist bashing and hopefully gain a new friend and teach them the better way. Post Script. I must be totally honest, however, sometimes I feel like locking the radical right wingers away and taking all their capital so they can feel what it is like to need!.

It has an unforgettable opening sequence, an ingenious denouement, and an interesting sleuth, especially created for the occasion, named Lucy Eylesbarrow. Although it is the elderly Jane Marple who exerts her powers of detection, she does it by remote control while her much younger friend does the spadework - or the domestic work. As Agatha Christie explains, ""The point about Lucy Eylesbarrow was that all worry, anxiety, and hard work went out of a house when she came into it."" Accordingly, the tertiary-trained domestic, Lucy, is soon installed in Rutherford Hall, where Jane Marple believes a body thrown from a train might be hidden.Surprises, further murders, gossip, marriage proposals, and poisonings follow in rapid succession, so that before you know it, the hours have sped by, the murderer is revealed, and you admit that once again you were quite unable to guess whodunit.Agatha Christie adds to the usual cozy elements of her murder mysteries a heavy involvement with passenger trains, timetables and railway matters so beloved of the British. Otherwise you'll find the book fits into the pattern of the dysfunctional family's struggles being worked out with a particularly stubborn, callous and crusty old man as the family's head.Feature film and TV adaptations of this novel have been made, the most faithful to the text featuring Joan Hickson who also can be heard in an unabridged reading on audiotapes."

1568950462,To the White Sea,,A2U4U0TKMQKN3,Brett A. Saffell,4/4,4.0,1173484800,Indirect writing style is original; story was unexpected,"I'd added this book to my Wishlist years ago, based on a list of great war novels I saw in a magazine. Based on the book's appearance on that list, I was greatly surprised by the content of this book; it was less a war novel than it was a story of a man in a crisis.As has already been said, it is a novel of an aviator shot down during a WWII bombing raid over Tokyo, and his story of survival. The novel has a single narrative and a single voice (the protagonist's), and no chapters. One story-line, one voice, and one long chapter has the potential for tedium, yet I found the novel to be gripping and excellent.Dickey's character doesn't really tell you what is happening to him, but relies on an indirectness to tell the tale. You don't so much get the action, rather you get the effect. You don't read the words of this novel; you just sort of take in the pages.As the story unfolds, the character's traits, flaws, and past transgressions seep out. It is a novel way to get to know a character. While this book moved slowly at time, and wasn't the war novel I thought it was, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it. I read Deliverance long ago, and am glad I finally read this novel."

B000FTCJIW,Kim,,A1LMBM1N4EXS5W,"thepaxdomini ""The Book Review""",2/7,3.0,1222819200,KIM by Rudyard Kipling,"Kim is Rudyard Kipling's novel about a white orphan, Kimball O'Hara, in India. It was first published in 1901, and is often considered to be Kipling's best novel. In the novel, Kim befriends a Tibetan Lama and becomes his disciple. Later, the British force him to attend a British school. Afterward, he rejoins the Lama, and becomes involved in political intrigue between Britain and Russia.Kim is noteworthy for Kipling's lush depictions of India, its people, its culture, and its religions. In spite of everything that goes on in this novel, there's no real plot - it's just Kim's wanderings around India. And this is the vehicle Kipling uses to celebrate India. This is well and good, but it isn't all that interesting. The story loses quite a lot of steam after Kim gets into British custody. Perhaps the story holds more allure for those of us who have not been to India (I have, several times).Ultimately, this is about as good a portrayal of India as you can find in a novel. That is what this book should be read for, not its story."

Deep in Rio's favellas, Tony learns that sometimes going along is the only way to stay alive. Still, life is mostly good--he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman, had a paying job, and Rio is in full carnival mode, with some of the world's most beautiful women on full display.Then the entire thing falls apart. His boss seems to lose faith in him, the gangsters are putting pressure on him to support them in a major heist, and his girlfriend seems to have a powerful boyfriend who wants to see Tony out of the way no matter what it takes. Tony, along with his friend and sidekick Rock Bottom, will have to move fast to stay ahead of the wave of disaster bearing down on them.Author J. R. Ripley does a convincing job portraying Rio de Janeiro in high carnival season. The samba beat, the contrasts of extreme wealth and abject poverty, and the curious position of law enforcement (being sometimes more dangerous than the people they are supposed to protect against) all ring true. The mystery itself is less convincing. When Brazil's Federal Police finally ask Tony and Rock for their assistance, one can only wonder why--it certainly isn't explained, nor does it make a great deal of sense. As a mystery reader, I also expect to learn all the clues that the point of view protagonist learns. In THE BODY FROM IPANEMA, a key clue was withheld from the reader but not from Tony, making the mystery perhaps more interesting from the reader's perspective, but fundamentally cheating on the implicit contract between author and reader."

The time frame begins around World War II and comes to the current period. The author vividly describes her life in Algiers. Although many times it is difficult to do in a biographical sketch, the author makes her characters come alive for the reader. As you read though the book you soon become one with it. Too often we have forgotten where we come from, I am thankful that Pierrette has not. You find yourself sitting in the caf&eacute; viewing what's going on. You see the people as they struggle to continue their lives amidst the confusion that war brings. You see Pierette grow up before your eyes and fall in love. You see her brother set out on the course that takes him to France.One of the great things, about the book, is the acceptance of people. You see people of different nationalities, different religious backgrounds and class levels living in harmony until the war changes things. You see them all be forced from that lifestyle to something different. You feel the heartache and the joy as you follow them through the author's eyes.Sharing with the author, I discovered that she left out many horrors from this autobiography that she experienced because of the tremendous sadness it brought back to her.I would recommend this book to anyone, on any reading level, especially if you like historical material. The insight that this book gives the reader is well worth the time it takes to read it."

These additions are a fascinating addition to Master Waysun Liao's story of Lao Tzu's visit to a border town in China before wandering across the Western mountains toward India. During the visit he reveals the secrets of living in the Tao. Portions of these secrets eventually become the text of the Tao Te Ching.The importance of this story is that it lends context to the enigmatic text of the Tao Te Ching. Without this context, the interpretation of this classic will vary widely. With the context of a story, there is a cohesive vision of the eighty-one chapters of the Tao Te Ching which explain how man may live in harmony with the world and the world unseen.The""Afterword"" is a conversation with Master Liao about interpreting the Tao Te Ching, religion, and the practice of Taichi today. He expresses a view that is insightful and controversial.Appendix 1 is a direct, character by character translation of the latest scrolls unearthed in 1973. These scrolls are felt to be the earliest record of the Tao Te Ching. This translation is keyed, line by line to references in the story. Thus a student of the enigmatic version of the Tao Te Ching can refer back to the contextual meaning given within Master Liao's story. It truly gives the poetry an enriched meaning.Appendix 2 is the original text, IN CHINESE, of the scrolls. This should be invaluable should an able scholar wish to understand the basis of Master Liao's translation.The third Appendix is a jewel of a glossary of 23 key terms used by Lao Tzu. Not only is the meaning of each term explained, but suggestions are made on how to incorporate the concepts into the reader's meditative practice. For example Master Liao explains how to use breathing techniques to reunite the mind and body. Appendix 3 will inspire many productive meditation sessions, sessions that hopefully will lead the meditator to experience the power of the Tao.The Deluxe Study Edition is definitely worth the additional money. With the study edition, the Tao Te Ching goes way beyond puzzling poetry; it becomes instead a resource for your practice, a practice that can guide you towards a life in harmony with the Tao."

It feels like something simply tacked on to give the book a romantic interest and I can't help feeling that the author didn't have her heart in writing these scenes. I skimmed over those bits in the end (especially when Mason was going on about wild birds of something) and I wish she had just concentrated on the restaurant and the relationships between the people who worked there - that was fascinating and I was constantly being amazed by the honesty and astuteness of her writing.

The book is a masterpiece, and, quite frankly, I couldn't put it down.On a superficial level, I enjoyed having so many ""Catholic words"" jarred from the recesses of my memory, some of which I hadn't thought of in over forty years. I'm talking about words like: lauds, compline, viaticum, oblation, preconciliar, oculus, plenary, monstrance, crucifer, chasuble, surplice, ciborium,paten, scavi, unction, aedicule, omphalos, cenotaph, cenacle, cardinalate, and laudation.Not only that, but for the past few days I've been humming to myself ""Tantum Ergo"" for the first time since, I'd guess, about the third grade, and the words are actually coming back to me! Even some of my old altar boy Latin is stating to come back: ""Ad Deum qui laetificat, juventutem meam...""But on a much deeper level the book is important because it illustrates very dramatically and profoundly the ""Catholic"" worldview, as distinct from even the ""Christian"" worldview and certainly from any ""secular"" worldviews.I want to thank Mr. Weigel for writing the definitive, must-read book for all Catholics. I will be recommending it to all my Catholic friends and relatives. By the way, the section of Chesterton is magnificent and well worth the price of the book itself. I hope Mr. Weigel will strongly consider for his next book an exposition of the major writings of Chesterton - making Chesterton accessible to the lay public."

B000LEHPUS,ttyl,,,,0/1,5.0,1141084800,TTYL,"1/28/06TTYLPublishier: Lauren MyrcleJillian TuellIf you have problems with friends, boyfriends, school, and people that just drive you crazy, then TTYL in definatly the right book for you. TTYL is about three best friends, Angela, Maddie, and Zoey. These girls are all going through changes in their life, but the hardest thing right now is trying to survive high school drama. The drama all started on Halloween with Maddie and her ""new"" friend Jana. Jana took Maddie to her brother's frat party and let's say, things just didn't go Maddie's way that night. Also, in the book, Zoey falls in love with her teacher, Angela and her boyfriend have a dramatic brake-up, and Maddie gets a new boyfriend.The TTYL characters are very interesting. Angela is a major drama queen, she makes such a big deal out of everything, and she always has to have the perfect outfit. Her importance in TTYL is that she helps to get Maddie out of her sticky situation. Maddie is more of the loner in the group, she always gets mad at people. Maybe that's why her screen name is ""MadMaddie"". Maddie is important because without her there wouldn't be any drama at all and the book would be boring. Now Zoey is the calm one and the good girl. She has to always calm Angela and Maddie down. She almost never gets into trouble, but at times she can be very sneaky about what she is doing. Jana, on the other hand, is the mean girl in the high school. Then, all of a sudden she and Maddie become friends and that causes a lot of the drama. Jana is the one who really gives the story its tuning point.I recommend this book TTYL, because I thought that it was a lot like what middle school drama is about. I also like this book because it is realistic fiction. It sends a message out to girls, that no matter how mad you are at someone, you will always care about them. When I read this I just couldn't put it down. This book is a good page turner, because of all of the exciting events in it, but I'm not going to tell you them. I say that I do connect with Zoey and Angela because it's hard to try to be on one side of your friends when there are three of you, and a lot of the time I find myself trying to calm down my friends too. So if you have problems with school, friends, boyfriends, or people that just drive you crazy, then TTYL is the right book for you."

About a month ago I walked from my girlfriend's living room to use the restroom. As I stepped onto the mat outside of the bathroom door I head and felt a strange click under my foot. Having seen many war movies and bad 70's TV shows I expected the worst. With my foot still pressed down, I carefully lifted up the side of the pink fuzzy mat to see a crudely built land mine. If I attempted to lift my foot I would be blown up. Upon closer examination of this deadly device I noticed an unusual amount of cat hair. I looked up and saw my girlfriend's cat glance at me and then scurry off. Soon the cat returned with a plate of fresh brownies. Wow they smelled good.

The Nazis ended the month of April, 1943 winning the Battle of the Atlantic in what they called ""The Happy Time"". One month later the U-boat forces were reeling. The Bay of Biscay which led to the great submarine pens on the French coast (which no doubt some of you bombed) was now a death trap for subs.Were you stationed by the North Atlantic, the Canadian Maritimes, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Cornwall or any of the other bases which provided air cover for slow moving convoys. Then you know what it was like to hunt and try to destroy the deadly subs. PBYs, Halifax bombers and the mighty Liberators turned the tide against the Enemy. The British even modified Libs to VLF Liberators. Very Long Range. Three fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bay and just one for anti-sub weapons. Missions were frequently 20 hours in length.The mighty pocket battleship Bismarck was so damaged by Faery Swordfish Mark 1 fabric covered biplanes that it could only steer in circles. It was sunk by a pack of British cruisers and other warships. The British also had great success with undersized war ships which some wag named the ""flower"" class. All the vessels bore names of flowers. Can't you just see a Monty Python skit where the Python crowd is standing over a chart table and the commander is saying ""Violet, you follow Rose and Ivy, pay particular attention to any periscopes you see.""Or picture a seaman's bar in Liverpool and in walk a bunch of tars from Flower Class warships. The beer fumes are thicker than a Newfie fog. ""Eh, mate, wot ship you from?"" ""Pansy!"" ""Wot you say?"" The sailors answer in unison. ""Buttercup!"", ""Daffodill!"" ""Forget-Me-Not!"" ""Damn right I won't . Put up yer dukes!"" POW! POW! SMASH!""The author doesn't describe the problems of Flower Class crews as I have but he does say the men had less and less trouble in port as their sub-killing reputation grew.Forty-one U-Boats were sunk in May, 1943, and 37 others were damaged and had to flee to the sub pens. Yankee shipyards were turning out Liberty ships faster than the Germans could sink them. Escort carriers appeared to provide further air cover and the Liberators kept the subs submerged and unable to fight at their maximum potential.Worse luck for the Germans was the loss of so many experienced crews. The fighting caliber dropped dramatically as losses mounted. Among those lost was the younger son of U-boat Admiral Doenitz. Chickens coming home to roost.Remember experiencing or reading about missions where 10% or more of bombers were knocked from the sky? The death rate for Germans who served on subs was 70%. That's right. Only 30% survived the war."
B000B770YG,Catch 22,,,,0/1,5.0,956102400,Much more than &quot;funny&quot;,"Catch 22 is one of those rare books that a reader can take from it whatever he or she wants. If it's humor you're looking for, then this is a funny, comical book to read with fast-paced, pinpoint dialogue (similar to the slapstick humor in Zuckers/Abrahams/Zuckers movies &quot;Airplane!&quot; or &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;). BUT FUNNY IS SUCH A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT. Catch 22 is rich with social and political symbolisim, which means if you're looking for something deeper than a &quot;good laugh&quot; there is plenty here to keep you busy thinking for a long time. Overall, I found Catch 22 to be a story of hope. That no matter how ridiculous or impossible the obstacles in front of you appear, you can conquer them with belief in yourself and a plan of attack."

B000QEARDU,Blessings,,AX54G5AL870Q8,"Ratmammy ""The Ratmammy""",5/5,5.0,1105228800,What a wonderful book!,"BLESSINGS by Anna QuindlenJanuary 9, 2005BLESSINGS by Anna Quindlen is probably going to make my top 20 list of books read in 2005. It is the story of Lydia Blessing, an elderly woman, heir to the estate known as BLESSINGS, built by her father Edward Blessing. Lydia Blessing is the last of her line. She's in her 80's, and her only daughter is childless and lives in the city. Throughout the book Lydia contemplates her life, and sees things as if she were living in her past. Her mind wanders in and out as she goes about her day, confusing the past with the present. Little things will remind her of her parents, her dear brother Sunny, or her dead husband Benny, and all will appear in her mind as if it were just yesterday. Through her memories, the reader will piece together the story of her life.In the opening chapter, an unknown couple dumps off a baby at the Blessings estate, and Skip (Charles) Cuddy, the handyman that lives above the garage, discovers the baby and decides to keep her. He tries to keep it a secret, taking the baby with him as he works and cleverly hiding the baby so no one will discover her. He is very afraid that someone will take the baby from him. Skip has never had a child of his own, but for some reason he is driven to take care of this one, whom he names Faith.Eventually, Lydia discovers the secret of baby Faith, but instead of calling the authorities, she helps Skip with the baby, and her life is instantly changed. She goes from a very rigid old-fashioned woman to a much happier person, looking forward to each day spent with the new baby and Skip. The housekeeper's daughter, college-bound Jennifer Foster, is also brought into the secret, and between the three of them, they take care of baby Faith, not even thinking that one day she may be taken away from them.Without giving more away, I found BLESSINGS to be a wonderful surprise of a novel. I bought the book a few years back, not knowing what to expect. I had read BLACK AND BLUE because of the Oprah name attached to it, and enjoyed it a lot, but BLESSINGS is a step above it. Quindlen does an excellent job at blending the past with the present, working inside the mind of Lydia Blessing and slowly revealing all her family secrets. Things are revealed gradually, as she herself is slowly remembering her past, her happy times spent with her beloved brother Sunny and his best friend Benny, who later becomes her husband.I also loved the ""old time"" feel of this book, since a lot of the novel takes place in the flashbacks of Lydia's memories. The Blessings estate is set apart from the town called Mount Mason, and is a secluded area complete with wildlife and tons of land. The backdrop of this place helps lend a feel to the overall story, one that is filled with nostalgia for the past and longing for things that are long gone. I loved Lydia's story, and the way it was told, in pieces, as if I was living inside Lydia's head. Overall, this book is a definite winner and will be on my top 20 list for 2005."

And when they adopt this new culture why they no longer associate with their own. It shows from babamukuru's generation up until the present won, the problems that a family had to endure. As mentioned before it most especially questions the validity of maintaining a way of life. It could also be regarded as a parallel to what was ocuring in Zimbabwe at the time. In essence it presents the question of the colonised mind... Good read all in all."

It almost reads as a Democratic Campaign leaflet against the Bush Administration's war in Iraq. It is horribly biased against the reasons for going to war. Atkinson makes it a point in almost every chapter to show how wrong and inept the Bush Administration's policies are. In the author's impressions of casual conversations, the attitude of the young men and women in the 101'st appear to also be very negative as to the reasons they are in Iraq and fighting the war. I would not recommend this book if you supported the war in Iraq.I highly recommend:""The March Up: Taking Baghdad with the 1st Marine Division""""None Braver: U.S. Air Force Pararescuemen in the War on Terrorism"""

While the convoluted and unclear plotline (which Faulkner himself detested enough to heavily reconstruct, revise at a personal cost of $270 in a time when that was a small fortune) is an obvious detriment, the gorgeous word choice, word placement, and sentence construction nearly make up for it. For a short example, I will submit the final sentence: &quot;She closed the compact and from beneath her smart new hat she seemed to follow with her eyes the waves of music, to dissolve into the dying brasses, across the pool and the opposite semicircle of trees where at sombre intervals the dead tranquil queens in stained marble mused, and on into the sky lying prone and vanquished in the embrace of the season of rain and death.&q! uot; Simply gorgeous; but the unconvincing story of rape, murder, lynching, a bumbling lawyer, a dangerous bootlegger from Memphis whose entire past history and motivation is described in 4 or 5 of the final pages, and many others can seem at times very outlandish and hard to follow, not from intrinsic, Faulknerian difficulty to read, but because of poor detail and a shallow style of writing. Characters have very little depth, and are afforded very short monologues when given one at all; Many characters, uncharacteristically, seem to simply not exist below the exterior, under the surface. However, if a reader can bypass this gruff outside layer of paint, Sanctuary has much to offer in way of the English Language."

Chamberlain towards the end of his long and productive life, the former soldier and college professor's book relates his thoughtful observations and recollections of the battles at White Oak Road and Five Forks from a selfless standpoint. He reminisces on the surrender at Appomattox and the last review in great detail with sensitivity and a touch of sentimentality towards the events. Chamberlain is an eloquent, perceptive writer who provides the reader with much valuable insight about the personalities and situations he describes.

I did not like the way Bronte made her characters so naive and how she made them have no common sense. I am glad I read this book and would recommend it to other people if they like confusing love stories about people who don't like each other. DWright"

The book was important for me to read because I have read many of Mr. Orwell's books previously.This work is a kind of investigative journalism of the 1930s. Although the main premise is to investigate unemployment, Mr. Orwell covers the class system and the future of socialism, and takes swipes at vegetarians, femininsts, and men with beards. He is delightfully cranky in his treatment of ""cranks.""The book is in need of a 21st century editor, someone who can explain the currency (Pounds/Shillings/Pence), who miscellaneous public figures are, and put the work into a context that a non-specialist can understand."

I loved Kenzie and Gennaro's blue-collar personas, the snappy dialogue, the vivid imagery, the deep secondary characters, and the deft balance of humor. It amazed me that mystery fiction could be so deep and touching, and I immediately bought the next book in the series, DARKNESS, TAKE MY HAND.DRINK convinced me to read more mystery fiction, but DARKNESS convinced me that I wanted to write it for a living.This book has everything DRINK has and then some: Memorable and sympathetic characters, crisp dialogue, excellent visuals, humor, the mafia, a serial killer, and best of all, a story that reached back all the way into Kenzie's and Gennaro's childhoods and rounded out the proceedings with an epic feel. Not to mention the climactic final&eacute; that reverberated through each one of the remaining books in the series. The suspense is thick, the action is whiplash, and the emotion is real and poignant. It has literally become the template upon which I've crafted many of my story ideas.My only complaint is that, with the ending in view, I guessed who the killer was. That took a bit of punch out of it, but the story quickly jumped past that and launched into the phenomenal climax.Lehane would revisit some of the same themes from DARKNESS in his breakout novel, MYSTIC RIVER, themes which actually began in much more diluted form in DRINK. In my opinion, however, the success of MYSTIC started here with DARKNESS, showing that Lehane had the stuff to move his audiences and keep them in tension at the same time. He's since started moving away from the mystery format, which is a shame, because the world needs more quality epics like this one. Before you pick up MYSTIC RIVER, buy DARKNESS and see for yourself where it all began."

By the Light of the Moon is no exception, with a writing style that often annoys, with its stupidly open manner and constantly inane similes that force the reader to question why bother? The trick is to stick with it to the end, and By the Light of the Moon eventually pays off.The story is an average one that seems to be all the rage at the moment: three characters (one an autistic man of twenty) are injected with an unknown golden liquid by a mad scientist subdues them, ties them up, and then sticks in the big needle. There is the warning from the doctor that the effects of this liquid can be both good and bad, and then he flees.So the three characters are irrevocably brought together to fight for their survival. Fortunately, it turns out that the mysterious liquid does good for all of them: one gains the ability, by touching objects, to know who last touched it and if they are evil, and is unable to stop himself from ending that evil. Another has visions of the future that actually will happen somewhere at some time. While the autistic man has the great ability to be able to fold time and space, transporting him and anyone else to anywhere and at any time, whether it be the past, present, or future, presumably.One would think this a great story, but the simplistic and annoying writing keeps getting in the way, as well as the plot that has very little depth.

The only clues are the role-playing game that the victim spent so much time playing, and his strange lack of a true identity. Turing assigned her two friends to find out more about the game and more about what Ray Santiago did before he became Ray Santiago and joined her company. What she doesn't expect is that she'll be sending her friends into danger--or that Santiago's killers just might be a threat for a bright artificial intelligence--like her.Author Donna Andrews does an excellent job making computer crime approachable, using non-technical language and humanizing her computer-program protagonist (as well as providing a couple of very human sidekicks). Turing's concerns about turning into HAL (from 2001) and worries about following the law and respecting privacy add to reader safety. The role-playing game that Andrews describes is also believable, even as it spills out from the computer into the real-world of Washington D.C. Andrews is a skilled writer and provides a page-turning thrill-ride.Although I liked Turing (despite her occasional descents into self-appraisal, I found sidekick Maude a little harder to like. Her moonlighting for Turing's company sounded unethical to me. Worse, she didn't seem to hesitate to shoot to kill, even when she wasn't fully aware of the situation. Nor did she seem to suffer any ethical consequences after she'd actually killed. The hints at the use of games for pedophilia also struck an incongruous note. Although this was an important justification for Santiago's initial involvement, Andrews should either have made this a bigger element or left it out.CLICK HERE FOR MURDER isn't a perfect story, but it is a well written and entertaining adventure. The use of an artificial intelligence character creates an enjoyable alternate spin to the usual mystery novel and Andrews develops this story line convincingly, in a way that will be enjoyable both to computer professionals and to those who remain a bit concerned about the role of computers in our lives."

However, this book, and the idea for the story, though it was amazing, was a blown opportunity. Making Cormac a figure that rubbed elbows with George Washington, Boss Tweed, etc., was too much, and the 'suspense' leading up to September 11 was a bit ridiculous. His writing seemed like he had to ensure 550+ pages to his publisher, at times. The story from Ireland to NY was great, but he really got carrid away and made too much of well known history (Draft Riots, Tammany, and others) and not enough of daily life.

The reader has a good voice and can do accents well but I absolutely hated the voice she did for Shay. It was annoying and kinda sounded like Susie from Rugrats.The story itself was okay. The concept is really interesting. I'm not gonna duplicate it here, you can just read someone elses summary. One complaint is, it was way too describey with action scenes just stretching for minutes and minutes and minutes. I really don't need to know Tally's every single move, it got boring. SOmetimes just saying 'After some stuggle, they escaped the danger.' Is enough! LOL well okay, don't be THAT brief, but what seems like 5 pages worth of action/description over and over again got really old.SPOILERS BELOWI really didnt like David's character at all. for all his posturing about beauty being on the inside, he totally was physically attracted to Tally more and just dumped Shay like a hot potato. like I understand that he was also into Tally for other reasons too (and also, hes some hormonal 18 year old kid, can he really help it?) but I think it was lame how he went behind Shay's back and let Tally deal with Shay's anger. not nice!!!!I also dont think it was cool of Tally to go with David since she supposedly loves her dear friend Shay so much. I mean whatever happened to 'chicks before d*cks?' LOLthat's basically it.

She could have been killed. So the producer of the soap puts her character in a coma so she can be protected (IF) someone is trying to kill her.

Then somewhere in Ohio another radio advice giver drowns in her tub. Is this a coincidence? On the basis of these two deaths she is encouraged by her manager, agent and producer to take a vacation and do a music video for a group called ""Kill Me Quick"". The vacation is endorsed by the sponser of the soap,( maybe because she would not jump into bed with him).

When he is not dancing in competitions he works with his brother who is married to a dancer who owns a dance studio. His brother is a PI.With all this background which makes me a little nausous. The book gets somewhat better, and the romance and romantic scenes are some of her better work. I was really getting into it and thinking she was going to pull it off. But the resolution was the pits. Totally unsatisfying. It seemed to be something out of a soap opera. I wonder if she wrote herself into a hole and needed a quick fix to get out.

It is not just one of those books that can be read on a whim but must be read in a quiet place, where there are no distractions. I give Gilead, though it was a good book a 4 because it took a little while to get into it.Once I was in the story I was hooked and actually finished the book within three hours. Recently I have been reading my ""teen"" novels just for something to read and I have come to the realization that I have outgrown them. They bore me, their problems and ideas are trivial unlike Gilead's, which are real, lifelike and not superficial.The story is told through a series of letters by narrator Reverend John Ames to his son. He recants about visiting the gravesite of his grandfather and how much he learned about his father while doing so. They are a soft family, kind, resourceful, and always positive. Though Reverend Ames is dying of a failing heart and has lived a hard life he continues to persevere and write in order to guide his son through life. Reverend Ames's first born, a daughter, died when she was a baby and now John Ames who is 76 will die before his sees his 6 year old son grow older.Gilead, to me is a story about finding yourself through the words of John Ames. It helps a person reflect on their own life and pushes the reader to think about his or her decisions in life. Gilead is inspirational and should be loved until the end of time because Reverend John Ames could be the person living next door. You never know."

It took me quite a few hours to read this three-hundred page novel, as it demands close attention. I kept notes as I went, for the chapters follow three paths in uneven and unpredictable portions: it centers around the near-future NYC of Antar, who investigates via the computer network he nicknames Ada the disappearance in 1995 Calcutta of a fellow employee of his firm. He found a bit of Murugan's i.d. card in an online archeological sift and so the hunt's on.Murugan, an irritating windbag who speaks in an affected hip-slang that is at least the novel's most memorable phrasing, as it crams a century of English jive and pose into a whirligig of a vocal register, finds his obsession with the real-life Ronald Ross, who took credit for malaria research earning him a Nobel Prize early in that same last century, overwhelming him, up to the mid-1990s. As a third setting, we witness Ross's discovery a hundred years before as it unfolds, with more than a little help from if not his friends than his pair of comely confidantes in Calcutta. One young woman wants to escape her suffocating home life there, and his quest to learn about the origins of the ""Calcutta chromosome"" and its apparent triumph of the powers of Silence over those of the Abyss (alluded to more than explained!) draws her in.Their interest is echoed in a tangent that takes the plot into haunted territory explored by a predecessor, who goes by the pen-name Phulboni. I won't tell too much about his own embedded tale, but it does stand out as a self-contained strong point. Much of the prose, outside of the windbag Phulboni (I think he was meant to sound as such!) and the importuning, brusquely buttonholing Murugan, comes via the more sedate search conducted by the low-key, and self-effacing Antar. This accounts for the lassitude of much of the story, as his sections while moving the plot forward the most for all their domination as a central protagonist often lack the verve of the Indian characters' sharper dialogue and brasher bickering.Later in the story, amidst a lot of medical characters from Britain and America, and many supporting roles (Romen especially) who gain sketchier mention, the convoluted plot careening between these three main time frames (and more scenes spin off of these, not always conveyed in the clearest manner, as didactic explanations must help the reader along by expository passages) may weary less attentive readers. As in such works of speculative fiction, the reasons for the cult's enigmatically symbolic ritual and the scientific legerdemain may sound more appealing the more they remain vague.Ghosh appears to have difficulty controlling the plot although oddly (compared to many reviewers), I found the first hundred pages slower, until the explanations for the book's title entered. He does assume his readers to have enough medical wherewithal to keep up, and he may over-estimate this capacity, as many terms aren't defined, as scientists rattle off dialogue among themselves. This is natural if overhearing them, but as with any author taking us into new territory, how to keep a learned conversation convincing while teaching the ignorant about its intricacies is no easy feat for writers.The pace remained uneven. The final section as it alternated an appealingly off-kilter conspiracy with a disappointingly hasty summation of the reasons for key elements introduced in Antar's case early on let me down. I wanted to learn more about the Europeans charged with their share of the propagation, and Ghosh is content to suggest lines to draw rather than to connect all the dots. Still, the final scenes however rushed (the chosen heroine possessed considerable sangfroid that I found hard to believe) do pack a punch as to their eerie suggestiveness, even if the revelation appears to evade verisimilitude. Those involved appear to take it in stride, while portions conveyed to those about to find it revealed confused me. But, as you expect by nature in a ""what if?"" work, this may be a fairly bargained if open-ended exchange."

Usually biographies don't interest me, they tend to be a little dry. But a book on Grant Green is a welcome to my shelves. The author gives a great, but brief, insight into the guitarist's life. She does this through stories from people who knew Green, this is the appeal of her novel. The discography section was a happy surprise. I get to see Grant Green through the eyes of the people who knew him the most. I just wanted more, that's all.The only question I have to the record labels: Why hasn't all of his music been re-released?"
0783804407,The King's Coat: The Naval Adventures of Alan Lewrie (Thorndike Core),,A2FZ3WRYGWFBOD,Rick Buchanan,1/1,4.0,917395200,Excellent mix of history and naval adventure,"I read a lot of military fiction, and this is by far the best British naval series I've ever read. I would call this &quot;Flashman Goes to Sea,&quot; since it has the same sort of ribald approach and a scoundrel hero who succeeds in spite of himself. Written by an American, the series, especially in the first few novels, has a distinctly American point of view. I read with interest the review from the writer who was critical of the &quot;homophobic&quot; bias of the author. While I'll admit that the protagonist, Lewrie, is a homophobe, this is not out of character for him, as he has suffered from the perfidies of his half-sibling, who is gay, and at the time he seems shocked and disgusted by his apparently homosexual superior officer, he is still shy of his 20th birthday. I, on the other hand, liked the descriptions of life aboard ship; the strong battle scenes; the fact that Lewrie is not the perfect little hero; and the glimpses of British Colonial life in both America and the West Indies. For anyone who likes naval fiction, I heartily recommend this series. I have just started the series by Patrick O'Brian, and the Lewrie books are far more &quot;modern&quot; and exciting, at least to me."

Booth ""Upward Bound""",8/17,1.0,1290211200,A Long Bleak Trip,"11/20/10 Zen and the Art of Motorcycle MaintenanceI've heard of this title and found it in the biography section of our library. The rave reviews encouraged me to read it.The story is of a man and his son who set out on a motorcycle trip across the upper West and Northwest eventually coming down the coast to California. The man is schizophrenic and interspersed with the travelogue are musings of his other personality (Phaedrus) on everything from motorcycle maintenance to Greek philosophy.Chris, his son, has problems of his own - mostly in dealing with the terrifying illness of his father. As the book progresses that travelogue sections grow shorter and long ramblings on philosophy and meaning-of-life take over.I found myself identifying with the son Chris throughout the book. It was a long joyless ride. I found myself slightly depressed everytime I read a portion. I was glad when I finished. I almost quit a few times but wanted to push through to the end. If this is Zen philosophy I want nothing to do with it. ""the road became so dark I have to turn on my headlight now to follow it through these mists and rains."" (pg 491)"
B00005W907,"Life, the universe and everything",,AXVXIWJ6IU6KA,"Clarinerd85 ""Rock on and be awesome.""",1/1,2.0,1283385600,Really not that exciting,"I was disappointed with this book, and really don't understand all the hype over it. Out of the first four books of the ""trilogy in five parts"" (I haven't read the last one yet), this one is by far the least engaging. As short as it is, it took me three days to read it because I found it difficult to absorb. There is a mere skeleton of a plot line, which might have taken all of five pages to tell if not for all of the meandering and weaving around the story line. Much of what happens throughout the story has little to do with what the characters set out to accomplish. I know that this is characteristic of the Hitchhiker series, but at least in the other books, the meandering and going off on tangents leads to a funny occurrence, or is at least humorous in itself. I didn't get anything like that out of this book. While there are a few funny lines in it, it hardly stands out in my mind as a good read."
5557123385,Sophie's World,,,,1/1,5.0,913852800,A Crash Course to Philosophy,"'Sophie's World' is a great mixture of fantasy and philosophy. It's an excellent book especially for those who are interested in philosophy but don't know where to start. It's gentle introduction to this subject that could very easily turn into a complicated jumble of theories, fails to lose the plot, both of what Gaarder is trying to teach us and of the story. Sophie's journey through this adventure, keeps us reading, not just to learn, but to know what happens to the young girl on her birthday. The constant twists, especially at the end, inabled me to put this book down. Gaarder's explanations of certain philosophical theories makes the book a lot easier to understand, and more believable due to the fact that I doubt that many teenage girls would understand the beliefs of Ancient Greecian men if laid out to them without any trace of an explanation. Overall, an excellent read, full of adventure and theories. Highly recommended."

B0009JKV74,DisneyWar,,A16CB9KZ8OER76,WLR,2/3,5.0,1113782400,What would Walt Disney think?,"This book could have been called `Michael Eisner, this is your life at the Walt Disney Company.' About ten years ago Michael Eisner had heart surgery which undoubtedly saved his life. Paradoxically, if he had died then he would have gone down in Hollywood history as the greatest studio head of all time. However, as this book describes, the events of the last decade have greatly tarnished Mr. Eisner. The author describes how, following the death of Walt Disney, the company languished in a slump for many years. Then they hit upon the idea of bringing Michael Eisner to Disney. Read about the amazing first decade when the Disney management troika of Eisner, Frank Wells, and wunderkind Jeffrey Katzenberg increased the financial worth of the Disney Company more than ten fold while, at the same time, achieving great creative and artistic success. And this is in spite of Mr. Eisner's ill-fated decisions concerning Euro Disney. Then Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter crash, Mr. Eisner had heart surgery, and Jeffrey Katzenberg was forced out. Read about how Mr. Eisner strung Mr. Katzenberg along for 19 years with promises of grandeur and riches only to push him out in the street when the time finally came to make good on all those promises. Of course, Mr. Katzenberg later became partners with David Geffen and Stephen Spielberg forming Dreamworks, which became a serious competitor for Disney. Read about how Mr. Eisner then induced his best friend Mike Ovitz, the Hollywood super agent widely considered to be the most powerful individual in Hollywood, to come to Disney. When it soon became clear that Mr. Ovitz intended to be more than just a rubber stamp for Eisner he was pushed out as well, costing the Disney shareholders $140 million for 16 months employment. At one point Mr. Ovitz had brokered a settlement with Mr. Katzenberg to drop all his claims against Disney for $90 million. Then, to nobody's great surprise except Mr. Ovitz, Eisner just flat out refused to pay. Eventually, Disney lost in binding arbitration and was obliged to pay Mr. Katzenberg $280 million, not to mention the millions spent on litigation. Read about the decision to buy the ABC television network for $19 billion and what it led to. Read about the falling out between Eisner and Steve Jobs of Apple Computer and Pixar. Read about the Comcast proposal in early 2004 to buy Disney. Read about how Mr. Eisner was able to stack the Disney Board with people that he could bend to his will, thereby making Disney a textbook example of how powerful corporate management can turn the tables on their board of directors and transform it into a rubber stamp. Someone once said that Napoleon Bonaparte was as great as a man can be without morality. Michael Eisner could be described as the Napoleon of the entertainment industry. Just as Napoleon was an upstart who crowned himself Emperor of the French and attempted to create the greatest empire in the world, this book describes Mr. Eisner's relentless drive to make the Walt Disney Company into the world's greatest entertainment company while, at the same time, in my own opinion, intending to ultimately push out the Disney family and make it into the Eisner family business. Eventually, all the powers of Europe combined against Napoleon and brought him down. Now we are witnessing all the Hollywood and entertainment people that were used and abused by Mr. Eisner over the years combining against him to attempt to bring him down as well. Roy Disney, now in his 70s, once disparaged as `Walt's idiot nephew,' has emerged as the champion of the Disney family interests, the Disney animators, shareholders, and pretty much everybody else that Eisner has burned. Together with long time Disney Board member Stanley Gold he initiated the wildly successful Save Disney campaign to withhold shareholder support from the Eisner management and Disney Board members. Read about how Walt's daughter Diane sent a letter to the Disney Board in February, 2004 which included her opinion that its time to select a successor for Michael Eisner who should then leave Disney when his contract ends in 2006. Mr. Eisner then called her on the phone and she repeated to him her opinion that its time for him to leave. She later repeated it again to the L.A. Times. Its all here in this book. If that's not enough to get you to want to read it then nothing will."

My family and I have been visiting the islands for a few decades, and ever since we found these guidebooks, we have used them exclusively. I don't know exactly how many years we've used them, but we've seen a few editions fill our book case.While some people won't necessarily have the same experiences as the author, all of our trips to recommended areas have resulted in enjoyment.If it wasn't for this series, I probably wouldn't eat at 'Da Kitchen' every time I'm on Maui.One thing to note, however, is that these guides were somewhat revolutionary in the extensive, unbiased reporting they provided when they first came out. Now that more people are using them and discovering the 'secrets,' not every place is as private as they once were. The hidden gems are now ""revealed,"" so one might find less traveled paths a little more occupied. However, while there aren't really new spots being pointed out (mostly just reiterations of old editions), they still are pretty spot on in the descriptions and suggestions.Be sure to check the publisher's website for updates, I mark them in my book to limit unwanted surprises each trip!"

It has 2-dimensional characters - a self-absorbed millionaire, a beautiful promiscuous daughter, a young idealist from a lower class, a cynical philosophical doctor - that debate obscure subjects at great length, utterly lacking in realism or drama or even intellectual interest. OK, it is supposed to be a black-comedic statement on California's narcissistic and superficial society, but it is really little more than a crushing bore. The plot revolves around the rich man's search for immortality, with a funny climax when he discovers what it will actually cost.Not recommended.

B000NXDSOE,It Wasn't All Velvet: An Autobiography,,A319KYEIAZ3SON,Mary Whipple,9/9,4.0,1164153600,"""Mel Torme is the only white man who sings with the soul of a black man.""","Attributed to the late Ethel Waters, this quotation is one of which Torme is so proud that he uses it to begin his autobiography. Written in 1988, Torme's life story describes his early years as a child prodigy--singing professionally from the age of three, acting in radio at age ten, writing songs professionally at age thirteen--and shows how he developed his career, became a movie star, was music director for Judy Garland's 1963 TV show, and worked with virtually every ""name"" in jazz, as a singer/songwriter, drummer, and concert artist.Throughout the autobiography, Torme keeps his perspective, taking the blame for many of his failures, and telling it ""like it is"" when, in his opinion, the fault belongs elsewhere. He is particularly harsh in his opinion of the recording industry: ""Some of the vilest people I have ever met are those who run and control the record industry,"" he says. His analyses of his marital failures, aggravated by the problems of being on the road, show the difficulties of leading a full life while always looking for the next big chance, professionally, and his sadness at his alienation from some of his children is palpable.For those who love jazz and the entertainment business, the book is fascinating, giving insights into Harry James, Buddy Rich, Chico Marx, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mercer, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dick Martin (of Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In). Torme's analyses of his professional failures (such as his disaster at the Copacabana) and of his betrayals by some of his ""friends"" show how closely some entertainers identify with their career decisions and how agonizing the ups and downs of professional life can be.Some of the book can be considered self-congratulatory, and other parts reflect Torme's desire to set the record straight (and give some payback for past wrongs), but the book gives an articulate and thoughtful presentation of the life of someone who has been considered the greatest male jazz singer of the twentieth century. A fascinating and insightful look at show business, with all its warts. n Mary Whipple"

This remains one of my favorite books of all time. One of the reasons is the author's love of language: not only does he know how to capture nuances in feeling and intellectual discourse; he knows that language is what distinguishes human from animal mating. The author loves to make up word endings, or new usages, and this is as thrilling as any other discovery, and this book is full of them, including the reader's realization that the author's abandoned thesis is re-written as nothing less than a study of Denoon, or the intellectuall male as viewed by the equally intellectually precocious female anthropologist. Margaret Mead meets Margaret Atwood. After a while, i just put away the dictionary and plunged on. The book is rewarding.

In that time, there have only been two books that I have started and not finished. I am a little obsessive about it. I keep reading books that I am just hating all the time. One of the books I stopped reading was Lord Jim by Conrad. I simply wasn't in the mood for his writing style at that time. I figured it was time to give it another shot.Conrad is a wordsmith and a poet. He is very descriptive, and you really have to pay attention to what you are reading(at least I do). It is very easy to read a paragraph and let your mind wander so that you don't know what you just read. I found myself reading aloud (which I never do) just to keep my mind on what I was reading. Poetry is always best read aloud anyway. I found myself really admiring his writing and wordplay. What's especially incredible is when you consider Conrad was born in Poland and English wasn't even his second language.The book is biographical and is based on Conrad's own voyage up the Congo river in the 1800s. Conrad's alter ego, Marlowe finds himself in the middle of the dark jungle in search of a man named Kurtz. There he discovers what happens when men are away from civilization and how dark their heart can truly be. The book is full of symbolism and I wish I could say I was adept at connecting all the dots but I wasn't. I was just enjoying what I was reading (at times admittedly a bit confused). Once I finished the book, I read the introduction by Joyce Carol Oates and appreciated the book even more.My favorite line of the book was: ""One can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse."" So true. I vow I will finish Lord Jim one day."

It is littered with thoughts and ideas that teenagers have in todays day and age. But the hardest part to figure out is where is Holden Caufield when he is telling this story? A guy asked me that once in Washington Square Park, and I absolutly coulnd't remember, so I picked the book up and read it again. Salinger out did himself on this one."

1858284678,The Rough Guide to Dutch Dictionary Phrasebook (Rough Guide Phrasebooks),,AZBGPVZNKVWJ0,David Somers,1/2,2.0,1121126400,convenient but not useful for travellers,"I used the book for two weeks driving around and doing business in The Netherlands and Belgium. It's sized so that I can keep it in a back pocket so I always had it with me. It might be a great book for people who have had some instruction and need refreshing. Since I had ""never seen Dutch before"" it was impossible to have a conversation using it.I never expected to talk, just read signs. But each time I tried, I only found half the words I needed. (I was driving and parking on my own and I'm sure I bypassed legal parking or parked illegally but was lucky. I also completely misunderstood a ""there's major traffic problems, find alternate route"" sign because too many key words weren't listed.) A section of ""common signage"" would be really helpful.The menu section was useful for $5-10/meal restaurants (whose staff may not be very good with English), but leaves out most of the fancy things at a good restaurant. (where there will often be someone who speaks enough English) (And if you're going to be in the area you have to treat yourself to good food - there's so much of it).I try not to be an Ugly American, but found that it was better to greet someone in English, because they'll instantly switch over to continue the conversation. But if you start in Dutch they assume you understand and chatter on too fast to follow. Get a local to show you how to say ""thank you"" and ""goodbye"" and other key phrases for the end of your conversation - there are lots of locals out there laughing at our mispronunciation of words that can't be described through dictionary phoenetics and include sounds that don't exist in American words.I wouldn't go back without it, but I'm still looking for a replacement that meets my needs for my return in a few months."
1558704612,Build Your Own Kitchen Cabinets,,A1J36EG44ZL3UG,Leigh Melton,8/8,5.0,990316800,Don't sell your kids to the gypsies to pay for that remodel!,"Before you pay anybody to come in and build a new kitchen for you, think about doing it yourself - at least _think_ about it and before you think about it, get this book! You may decide that this isn't for you, but you'll make an INFORMED decision. Maybe you'll decide (as we have done) to do make the cabinet bases and purchase the drawers and doors (and save a lot of money) or even go whole hog and build everything yourself (and save a lot MORE money) but no matter what you decide, read this book first. It's not aimed at professional woodworkers but for those who at least know which end is up on a hammer. Written in an easy-to-read style, lots of clear photographs, good diagrams and some examples of successful remodeling ideas make this an invaluable book to anyone who wants some individuality to their kitchen remodel. It may be easier to buy something off the floor at the local superstore, but this book will show you creative ways to get what you *want* instead of just what you can afford."
B0007EOD9I,The once and future king (A laurel edition),,,,2/2,5.0,1089417600,An impressive read.,"I must say, the first time I perused this particular selection, I was bored to tears by it. A high school student forced to do as such, I found reading through White's tome of knights and adventures to be extremely tiresome. It was only on my second go through, some years later, that I recognized this work as one of the best pieces of literature to grace my library.T. H. White goes to great depths to properly craft his characters, and remains true to his depictions throughout the five books comprising his depiction of the Arthurian legend. All the famous figures - Arthur, Guenevere, Lancelot, and Merlyn, to name a few - are given a new lease on life, and for the first time, we are given a good look at their personalities, from fears to secret desires. White reminds us through his ingenuity and silver tongue that even the greatest of people are fallible, as witnessed in the fall of Lancelot. The reader is given, for the first time that I can recall, a deep look into the thoughts of each character, and what drives their actions throughout the course of each novel.White's derivations from traditional Arthur also give his work a strikingly original air, casting old characters in occassionally new roles while still largely following the legend. His work with Merlyn struck me as particularly interesting: a man travelling backwards in time, who knows already the sad fate of Arthur yet who does his best to steer Arthur in the proper direction. Of special note is Merlyn's outlook on 'might' versus 'right', and the struggles Arthur has with this issue throughout the tenure of his reign.On the whole, it is well worth the read, especially if one is a fan of the Arthurian legend. My only complaint comes in the scope of White's narrative; he is, at times, very long-winded, supplying several expansive passages and descriptions that are rather superfluous, and excessive. If you can suffer such things, however, I would highly recommend this brilliant story."
0972247823,Bryan Kest: Advanced Yoga (CD & Booklet),,A2T42V2NAC83AW,Alymom,6/6,4.0,1141776000,"Very good, only one complaint:","This a a great CD and booklet to have in your collection if you are an intermediate to advanced student. I really like to use it together with my practice at the studio. I quite like Bryan Kest's style of teaching because he is honest about what you have to do to achieve the routine. He's very motivating for me, despite what others have said in their reviews. I wish he'd come out with more of these sets, and I'd probably buy them all if they were at this advanced level. Bryan Kest does not have a typically soothing, meditative voice, yet he brings home the meaning behind the asana: keep the focus on your breath, even during the tough poses.My only complaint is that the CD abruptly ends, and yet there is only 15 minutes on the second CD. There is plenty of room for a nice meditation/relaxation sequence at the end of this, and I feel that its something that really SHOULD be done after investing 90 minutes in this routine. One can do it on their own, but why not have him fully complete the practice?"

One, which hasn't read LoTR and the other which has read it. But believe me when I say that even this statement doesn't express much enough the greatness of this magnificient story. The story is simple and yet an epic. Its about how even the smallest of things can change the tides of time and face of the world. This is a story of all stories. Theres fantasy, adventure, mystery, suspense, humour, romance in this saga of friendship, honor, loyalty, sacrifice, courage and bravery.There's one powerful ring, which is to be destroyed before it falls into the hands of evil orelse the world will fall into Darkness forever. It can only be destroyed by throwing it into the cracks of Mount Doom. This responsibilty comes upon the shoulder of one little hobbit, frodo baggins.In the entire story, Tolkein never mentions anything about Life, but after reading the story, you'll yourself realize how wonderful Life is and how a person should respect and enjoy it and thank God for such invaluable gift. In short, Life is a journey to one of the biggest celebration of the Universe. The meaning of Life is Life itself and Death is the celebration of all the moments of good and bad things happened to you;the moments of happiness, sadness, fear, joy, love, hatred, hope, despair;the moments you have spent in light, darkness, morning, night, summer, winter and all the moments you have lived through out your life.READ THIS BOOK AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING.

A sober and vital reminder of the atrocities humanity is capable of, and the need to prevent the Holocaust from happening again."
B000MWG69U,What Jamie Saw,,,,11/14,4.0,902275200,This book deals with child abuse.,"This book deals with the abusive behavior within a family. The family consists of a mother: Patty, a father: Van, a step-son of Van's: Jamie a 3rd grader, and a daughter of Van's: Nin a baby. Jamie wittnesses his step-father Van throwing his step-sister Nin across the room. His mother, Patty, immediately takes the children out of the house. It's freezing cold, December and Christmas is nearning. She is careful to bring warm clothes and blankets. She also brought the children's toys as well as Jamie's magic book. Jamie loves to perform magic.A friend Earl helps them by giving them an old trailer in the woods to live in. The trailer has very little comforts. Patty has very little money. Jamie is kept out of school for several days while he and his mother cope with their situation. Patty tries to make ends meet by working part-time at the local A&amp;P gorcery store. Jamie's teacher comes to find out why he's not in school and how she can help. She offers to keep! Jamie after school on Tuesdays so Patty can attend a self-help group.The devestated family has very little to eat let alone spend on Christmas. Patty wants to make their Christmas enjoyable but can't afford to buy to much. The family decorates a small pine tree outside their trailer with makeshift oranments. Also, their friend Earl comes just before Christmas and brings a few gifts for them. Jamie gets a pair of ice skates. Earl and Jamie skate on a nearby pond. They have wonderful time. For a moment Jamie forgets his pain, forgets what he saw.Jamie is sadden by his situation and lives in constant terror that Van will find them and hurt Nin. Jamie loves Nin and his mother and wants the pain to stop. Van locates the family and comes to make peace with them one day when Jamie is left alone to tend to Nin. Jamie is frieghtened that Van will break in the trailer door and hurt or possibly kill them. In desperation he hides a sleeping Nin under the only bed in the trailer, ! being careful not to wake her, for he fears her cries may a! lert Van to their presences. Van comes into the trailer and Jamie tries to act as if Nin isn't there. Jamie now fears that his mother will come home and Van will hurt her too, so he tries to distract Van by showing him magic tricks. Jamie loves to perform magic. His mother Patty comes home and finds Van in the trailer with her children. She demands that Van leave them alone. He leaves without incident and this is when Jamie, Nin, and Patty realize that they made the right the choice to leave a bad situation.This book is heartwarming, but only at the end. It is descriptive when outlining the abusive situation; therefore, I recommend that a parent or teacher be present to answer any questions a child may have. Child abuse it something that is ever present in out society and must be dealt with. This book can faciliate a meaningful decision on the topic. Their is so much more to this book. It's only a 126 pages, but it says a lot. Enjoy!!!"
B000K6SZ74,Force Of Reason,,A1ZDPQA6FLY8XM,Lubos Motl,11/11,5.0,1158624000,A hero of our time,"Oriana Fallaci, a famous journalist and former antifascist partisan, offers her fascinating views on Islam, its history, and the threats facing the Western civilization as well as her personal story that has become even more striking after the 9/11 attacks. For security reasons, Fallaci had to move to America, a country she views as the main hope of the Western civilization, and so do I, a citizen of the Czech Republic.During the last years, she became the target of many fanatical Muslims and their fatwas as well as their left-wing allies who have made her life in Italy virtually impossible: her identification with Master Cecco, a victim of the inquisition, is certainly justified. But it was cancer that ultimately killed this extraordinary woman last week.Much like Fallaci, I count myself as a Christian atheist. As most scientists, I appreciate the tough struggles between science and Christianity in which the Church was wrong. Nevertheless, these old disputes seem rather subtle in comparison with the outrageous recent attacks against the main principles underlying the Western civilization, including the power of reason and arguments as opposed to violence and intimidation. Why were the controversies relatively subtle?As the Pope Benedict XVI, who privately met Fallaci a few months before she died, recently explained in Regensburg, the God of Christianity is restricted by His own words and by the laws of logic and mathematics. Allah is not restricted by anything and his followers are not restricted either. They will do anything to spread their beliefs. This fact is magnified by the ambiguous relation between the Quran and violence. Fallaci explains in detail how the Muslim clerics in Europe - a part of the future Eurabia - teach their believers that they shouldn't be restricted by the local laws.Fallaci writes that the threat that the whole Western civilization faces is amplified by the political correctness and by multicultural utopists many of whom have openly become the fifth column of jihad. I have just read a shameful anti-papal (and anti-Fallaci) article in the Guardian and it looks really scary where we seem to be going.As Fallaci convincingly argues, the presence of Islam in the West is directly proportional to our loss of freedom. Her personal experience is captivating but it is not really new to me because I have been exposed to remotely comparable kind of pressure. Everyone who advocates a principle that is inconvenient for various groups of people that are presented as ""suppressed groups"" and especially for their inferior ideologies - even though these ideologies are really starting to control our lives - is immediately hated by a certain segment of the society and labelled as a racist. I know these things extremely well and it was refreshing to read stories from someone with a similar attitude.This new book as well as Fallaci's example should wake up millions of people and make them realize that if they won't actively try to defend the Western values against the pressure of an Asian religion and against the cancer of political correctness, the civilization as we know it could face a genuine risk of destruction."

B0000YSH2E,The English Roses,,,,43/45,1.0,1066608000,Poor,"This is a weak, unimaginative book that comes across as an amateur offering at best. In fact, my eleven year old niece has written more engaging stories in her English assignments. It's a basic story with flat prose (a pretty little girl is ignored by her peers because they're jealous of her looks. In steps a fairy godmother to show them that the girl's life is actually quite sad, so they should be nicer to her). This book seems to be too basic for the age-group it's aimed at (i.e. the `peer' age of the girls in the story of 8+), yet it's probably not pertinent enough for children who tend to have picture books read to them. In my experience most toddlers are content to interact with all children (in fact younger kids invariably gravitate towards the more aesthetically pleasing of their peers). The book also skips the issue of how children ought to treat beautiful peers who don't have dead mothers. I thought that you were supposed to be nice to people no matter what. This book seems to say, okay, the kid's prettier than you but hey, be nice, her mom's dead. This is a one-dimensional offering that simply doesn't cover the real issues of jealousy and ostracism. It also seems to ignore the fact that, in today's world, it's the plain, overweight children who are usually left out. All in all, it's pretty terrible."

She spews contempt for Republicans, Texans, New York and New Yorkers, has unnecessarily bad language throughout the book, and at one point finds it acceptable that a friend is engaging in Internet sex with a married co-worker on the opposite coast. Sorry, she's just not my kind of person.Many people around age 30 are struggling to establish their identities and are trapped in mind-numbing directionless jobs. Like many, Julie found something to do: Cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in one year and blogging about it. No doubt this was a huge challenge that was personal stretch for her, but in my mind it's hardly anything notable. Lots of people stuck in dead-end jobs and mundane or unchallenging or in some way difficult lives(or not) undertake large personal challenges: they volunteer for non-profits, decide to run a marathon, write a novel, climb Mt. Everest or go back to school. Some of these efforts even contribute something to society in the end. Julie's challenege is no more exceptional than any of these and in many cases is less exceptional. So she cooked her way through an entire cookbook. So what? Why was the self-imposed timeline so important that it caused her enormous angst? Why does she live and work in New York if she hates it as much as she seems? It's never clear why she's there in the first place. And at the end of ""The Project"", she still remained a foul-mouthed, jaded New Yorker with contempt for people with personal views different than hers, except now she is one with a book and movie deal. I don't get it.The writing was fragmented, the book frequently wandered, and it took me a long time to wade through the book. There was less about Julia Child and her life than I expected. And frankly Julia Child, who in her quest to accomplish something with her life in her 30's and 40's, gave us all something we could use: books and a television program that led to a sea change in the attitudes about food in the United States that was much needed in the 1960s and 70s. It's the reason she's still iconic today, even if some of the recipes are dated. And she managed to do it all with resorting to constant profanity.If you want to learn more about Julia Child, read ""My Life in France."" While she also clearly identifies her political views, it was in the context of her lifelong disagreements with her father, which was clearly a personal struggle. But to my knowledge, she never served a dish containing glass chards to Republicans."

It was very important to me to have one of us there to raise our own children (not daycare) so we waited until we had purchased our first house and we found that my husband's job was sufficient to cover our needs. This meant that we got a little later start than most and we had a few less toys than some, but it was worth it to both of us! 30 years later, I lost my husband and had to make some hard decisions again, as I still have two young children at home. After allot of research and creative thinking, I opted to turn a hobby of mine into a job that I could do from home. It isn't easy, I don't draw a huge income, but it makes ends meet and I can give the same TLC and attention that I gave to my older children to my younger two.I agree strongly with the author, if you have children, then you need to fit the career to the children, not the other way around. Children deserve our best, not our leftovers at the end of the day, after all, they are not an accessory and they need and want our focus. I enjoy my children and my career, though after losing my husband, I was told that the only option that I had was working full time. I am sorry, but those nay sayers don't give women enough credit! How sad that so many leave their young children for other's to raise, simply because they don't believe that staying and/or working at home is an option!"

I promptly fell in love with the French version, &quot;feeling&quot; the meaning of the words as much as I was understanding them with my third-year French language capacity.

There's a glossary at the back, because he uses street slang from the 1930s Chicago scene as he would speak. Which adds to the rich atmosphere immensley, but takes some getting used to. This is a book that can be enjoyed at a plethora of emotional and intellectual levels.The skill with which this book is written is matched by it's contents.

5557096396,A Farewell to Arms,,A7SSCDSCM4PXF,booknblueslady,1/1,4.0,1316304000,War and love,"A Farewell to Arms is Ernest Hemingway's story of war and love set in Italy during World War I. Hemingway uses his earnest sparse journalistic style to tell the story through the perspective of volunteer ambulance driver Frederic Henry a young architecture student from the United States. Frederic is a young man who noticed the landscape around him the fields, the mountains, the humidity, the crops, the buildings and the roads and rivers. He has an easy camaraderie with the soldiers around him. As Frederic returns from leave he states:""I left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine open and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the cars. They were moderately clean a few freshly washed, the others dusty. I looked at the tires carefully, looking for the cuts or stone bruises. Everything seemed in good condition. It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things or not. I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were obtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended on a considerable extent on myself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not.""He soon meets a young Scottish nurse named Catherine Barkley and they begin to fall in love during the difficult wartime setting. It is interesting that Hemingway who has such dynamic conversations between comrades in arms has such banal and saccharine conversations between the two young lovers. Through hardships and difficulties they never seem to progress beyond smoochy, smoochy.With Hemingway's spare style he has chiseled Catherine down to a shell. She doesn't exist as a solid being without Frederic whose voice we constantly here though rarely do we here his name. It is surely written in full no more than five times in the book. And yet in his commentary on war, we read that it is indeed the names that are concrete and real:""I did not say anything. I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost our of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and I had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages , the numbers of roads a, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.""When one examines the plot, it is quite wonderful and exciting, with the daring and dangerous escapades one expects of a war time story, combined with the angst and yearning of young love. While it may not be an antiwar novel in the truest sense A Farewell to Arms certainly provides a realistic look to the confusion of war along with a look at the common valor which goes with being a soldier.While it may not be everyone's cup of tea for a variety of reasons, A Farewell to Arms surely deserves its place among the classics."

The plot was your pretty standard fantasy fare, but there were enough interesting wrinkles to keep me engrossed. Some other reviewers have commented on the wordy or repetitive nature of the book; I did not find that to be the case. Rather, unlike other novels which cover a lot of ground, and jump around from character to character, this one stays with a scene for a long, long time and slowly builds until that scene concludes and then the next scene is begun. So if you prefer your action fast and furious, with lots of threads simultaneously interweaving, then this is probably not the book for you. Instead you will stay with the same characters as they slowly work their way through a particular part of the story (Westlands, Boundary, Mud People. Agaden Reach, Tamarang, People's Palace pretty much it for 800 pages); I could see that being tedious for some readers who want things to move along faster, it was not so much for me, although I would agree the part with the Mud People started to drag, and the graphic scenes with the Mord-Sith did feel gratuitous so that part could have been trimmed to take some of the brutality out. But overall an enjoyable ride."

(The books are only loosely connected. You can read one with out reading the others, or read them in any order you wish.)The novel is fast paced. The action is crisp and exciting. Yet it is not a shallow novel at all. There are some deep themes that run throughout.The characters are great. These are the best Gemmel has done, and he does great characters. They are all flawed, but their flaws do not keep them from being heroic and likeable.Gemmel introduces some new cultures here to and it works very well. For the first time he has some ""chinese style"" characters (my favorite in the book) and a ""jungle/rainforest"" type character.The plot works great. A group of heroes start off on what at first seems like an insignificant quest to rescue a peasant no one cares about. Each has his own motivations for taking this on. Soon we see that the quest was much larger (and important) than it at first appeared to be.All told this novel is brilliant. I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you read Gemmels first two, then you owe it to yourself to read this one. If you have not read Gemmel, do not worry, this is a GREAT novel."

Sorry to spoil that part of the story but it takes about 50% of this forced march of a story to get there and some people might drop out of the column from exhaustion or boredom before they get there. I really wanted to like this book. Truly I did. And while the end of the story made some of the pain getting there worthwhile, it wasn't good enough to justify some of the unnecessary fluff and subplots that really bloat this story.The first half of the story builds and builds (and builds and builds) until the climactic event is a lot less impressive than it could be because you've known for ~75 pages exactly when it is going to happen. This is unfortunate because all the dragging out hinders what would otherwise be a good beginning. The story is a little dated, but that is to be expected and I can't hold that against the author or the story.The post-event half of the book is OK. More dragging and more bloating until you finally make it to a pretty good ending. The last 50 pages of this book are a great ride.Specific Complaints (minor spoilers)Apparently you are required to comment on the controversy surrounding race and the portrayal of African-Americans in the book. I wouldn't go so far as to say that there was blatant racism in the book, but if it were written today I do think a lot of the situations would've been treated differently concerning the African-American characters, specifically the army.I actually had a bigger problem with the pseudo sexual predator Scout Master. I felt like that was an aspect of the story that could have been left out as it didn't add anything to the plot and felt more like a band aid when the authors realized that they forgot to rectify the scout's subplot. It is unfortunate they decided to go this route. Others may disagree as is their right."

Inazo Nitobe's treatment of Bushido is unfortunately shallow. He innumerates a number of ""virtues"" that are important in Bushido but does not dig very deeply into them. After reading about half of the book I feel that I do not have a deeper understanding of some of the peculiar quirks of Japanese culture.If one is looking to deepen their understanding of Bushido I would suggest Sir George Sansom's three volume set ""A History of Japan"", as it is yet the standard in Japanese historical studies. Also, ""Training the Samurai Mind"" is a wonderful collection of translated primary documents written by samurai who lived primarily during the Edo period. Also, Miyamoto Musashi's ""Book of Five Rings"" is another useful book for those interested in samurai and Bushido.If one is simply interested in depending their understanding of Japanese culture I suggest undertaking a study of Confucianism, Buddhism, Shinto, and of course Sansom's books. Nitobe's book is unfortunately a giant waste of time."

However, reading the book about 45 years after it was first published, its age begins to show, with some old-fashioned chauvinist ideas creeping in, an incredibly biased point of view towards the European/American model of society as the only one that matters; and a surprising amount of false and outdated psychological ideas ascribed to people (surprising given that the premise of the book is that we are far closer to our animal nature than we care to admit).I would still recommend reading The Naked Ape just because it is an important milestone in the history of cultural anthropology/evolution, but would take a lot of the conclusions with a healthy dose of skepticism.

At the outset we're asked to accept the fact that a woman's husband buys a house without her seeing it, and that the house, of all the houses in this country, turns out to be the very house where she killed her mother decades ago. Of course, she had never told her husband that this had occurred. The plot goes further awry from there.The characters are unreal, scarcely two dimensional, and there's not a single one that is likeable or with whom a reader can comfortably identify. The four-year old boy can serve as an example. ""Cute"" is not character.The dialogue is wooden on every page. Characters speak as if they were refugees from a third-rate Victorian melodrama.The atmosphere, a wealthy bedroom community in New Jersey is boring.

B000NWL4LO,Fundamentals of Prosperity,,ACRZYLUA1BWJ5,Gary Howell,0/0,2.0,1325289600,Started great ended poorly,"This book started out great and was very inspiring at first. The premise of the book is that prosperity doesn't come from wealth, education, or an abundance of natural resources, but rather it comes from the human spirit; to which I agree. He went on to say that prosperity comes from God and that we should seek God first; to which I also agree.Toward the end of the book however, he departs from sound logic by devoting an entire chapter to his idea that all churches in America should be reorganized so that they have rotating preachers each of which preaches only on his area of expertise and that the message being taught should be one of prosperity. This book, written in 1920, may have been the beginnings of the prosperity gospel so prevalent today.Babson seems to suggest, in the second half of the book, that the purpose of the church is in teaching people how to become prosperous, rather than in teaching people to have a relationship with Christ.The prosperity gospel is, of course, false because it cannot be applied to everyone equally. A boy in India who lives in a grass hut and has to walk five miles each day just to collect drinking water from a polluted river will not, by applying biblical principals to his life, find himself moving into a three bedroom condo with running water. Mr. Babson seems to overlook this simple fact."

B00088M2VE,Martin Eden,,,,14/17,5.0,914976000,Jack London's &quot;Allegory of the Cave&quot;,"I think that every book falls into one of a few different catagories. It either sucks, is entertaining, or changes your perspective. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; ranks in the highest of all posible catagories for changing my perspective. I tried to read Jack London on a number of occasions and just couldn't get into him. His stories would rate as entertaining at best. I don't know why I picked up Martin Eden, but will forever be grateful to the forgotten soul who recommended it. Martin Eden is different because of what is barely under the surface. In my opinion, it's less a story than a philosophy. After I read it for the first time, I was struck by the parallel to Plato's &quot;Allegory of the Cave.&quot; In it, Plato warns of the price of enlightenment. Once you have seen the light, you can never go back to seeing things the was you did before. You will isolate yourself from everyone. Plato seems to say that ignorance is bliss, and London seems to agree. In the novel, Martin is stricken with the desire to ascend in class stature after meeting a high-class, late 19th Century San Fransisco family. He is enamored with the ease with which they debate social politics and wants to attain what he first sees as their level of intelligence. His vehicle for attaining their acceptance is to become a writer. To enrich his meager knowledge of these subjects he becomes an arduous reader of everything that he can get his hands on. In the process, he comes to realize that he has gained a true understanding of liturature and social philosophy, whereas everyone else merely talks with a false air of understanding. At one point he realizes that, in his quest to become an intellectual equal, he has surpassed them. It is after his meteoric climb in intellect that he realizes that he is alone. He also realizes that the people he so eagerly sought to emmulate did not shun him because of his lack of intellect (for their own intellect was merely a thin veneer), but because of his lack of money. In his separate but related quest to become a successful writer, he is frustrated by every publisher's inability to &quot;get&quot; his ideas. His inability to publish, despite his hard work, leads his love interest, high-born and condescending, to abandon him. She has no faith in his ability to achieve fame as a writer and he has no disire to settle down into a 9 to 5 job to placate her socialite parents. After some time apart, he does succeed in getting published, and not unlike the breaking of a dam, fame and fortume follow soon after. Upon learning of his fame, she comes running back, ready to make him the centerpiece for conversation at her family's socialite dinner parties. He rejects her and tries to return to the companionship of his earlier days as a sailor. Like in Plato's story, he finds that he cannot rekindle the bond that he once had with old friends, and is alone.While the story is an interesting case study into the nature of intellect and society, it is also a looking glass into the social scene in a major city during the turn of the century. The reader learns that the beat poets were around long before Kerouac and Ginsburg. This story is full of information -- social, political, historical, and intellectual. Read it."

Fortunately I was not disappointed.The Plot:Eve Dallas in a Lieutenant of the New York Police Department in the year 2058. She is currently investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute. On her long list of suspects is Roarke, a multi-billionaire charmer. As Eve finds herself emotionally involved with Roarke, even to the point of trusting him, the pressure is on for her to find the real killer.What Makes It a Five Star Read:The suspense and mystery are unquestionably entertaining. The romance is hot and sweet. The balance between the two is flawless, a tribute to Robb's impeccable writing style. The tone of the whole book makes it flow easily and quickly.To me the series looks very promising. I would recommend this book to fans of mystery, suspense, and romance."

That's because it's really three, or maybe four, or depending on your point of view, perhaps five books in one. It's the story of the hostage crisis in Iran in 1979.The first book is the story of the hostages taken from the embassy. This covers them as individuals, their duties in the embassy, their lives as hostages. A surprise was how poorly they were organized to collect useful intelligence.The second book is on the students that stormed the embassy. They first did this somewhat as a lark. And it grew beyond them. A surprising part of their story is how ignorant they were of world affairs beyond their own lives. And finally how they have suceeded in the government of Iran since. But you have to wonder what would have happened if the Marine guards had started shooting.The third book is on the Delta Force and 'Operation Eagle Claw.' As we know it was a disaster. We really didn't realize just how bad it really was. Let's hope we do better on the next such event.The fourth book is on the American diplomatic response and President Carter's actions and decisions. This part also discusses the world's response and that of the United Nations which basically issued public statements.The fifth book if you can say it exists, is on the overall relationship between the United States, the west and radical Islam.We really don't know what happened in incidents like this one until we read the well researched books books such as this one that seemingly can't be done until the political passions have died. This book is exactly that kind. I can only add my two cents to the other reviewers who say that this should clearly get one of this year's Pulitzer's."

It started off boring and ended with a dissappointing conclusion. Even though I love Jacen and Jaina, this book really never made me care for either one of them. They seemed stuck up, snooty, and were constantly whining. A friend that they meet, Lusa, is essentially a glorified centaur. This really bothered me, because in Star Wars you would think that an author could manage to think of some half way original creature. Everyone acter uncharacteristically, particularly Luke, who seemed depressed and self centered. Han and Luke's purpose in the story was pretty forgetable, and the bits with Chewie in them were truly abysmal. If I didn't reserve the one star rating for books like the Black Fleet Crisis, or I, Jedi, then I would have rated this book that way. Buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina instead. You will thank me later."

This is largely due to the fact that the primary character for this book, Brujah Archon Theo Bell, is easily the most interesting, most sympathetic character that we've seen in the series. Granted, we've seen him in earlier books, and had a definite impression that he was a likeable character (if not one that I'd necessarily want to meet in a dark alley)even then. But this book fleshes out the character quite well, and makes him even more worth knowing about in the process. Impressive, considering that I've never considered clan Brujah to be my favorite clan."

The author has a gift for putting together a compelling narrative about the unusual ordeal of the whale ship, Essex, which sailed out of Nantucket and was done in on the high seas by an extremely aggressive sperm whale who attacked it. So complete was the damage that the ship sank, its crew of twenty cast adrift upon a seemingly infinite ocean to find their way back home in three small boats. This real life, unheard of attack by a whale was the basis for Herman Melville's classic work of fiction, ""Moby Dick"".What the author does is ground what happened to these most unfortunate of men in the historical context of the time. He paints a picture of the milieu in which they lived. Their lives were governed entirely by the whaling industry that was the bread and butter for Nantucket Island, the whaling capital of the world.Drawing upon narratives by some of the survivors, as well as other historical data, he paints in intricate detail what life must have been like for these men. He weaves a tapestry of early nineteenth century life on the island of Nantucket and the preeminence of whaling in the lives of those who lived there, as well as the role of the Quakers. In essence, he brings the men, who were involved in this most notorious of survival at sea stories, to life for the reader.It is a balanced narrative. This was to be the first voyage as Captain for the democratic George Pollard, who was teamed up with a very aggressive and ambitious first mate, Owen Chase. This was later to prove to be a poor combination. Nearly a third of the crew was African-American, which was an interesting twist, arising out of the abolitionist views of the Quakers, whose views were the mainstay of Nantucket. Most of the crew was very young, the cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, being but fourteen years of age.When the Essex was attacked while on the high seas by a gigantic, aggressive sperm whale and destroyed in the process, the story of the what happened to the crew makes for one of the most engrossing and amazing stories of survival ever to be told. Against the odds, eight of them survived their ordeal, which lasted for months. Dehydration and starvation were to drive them to a new frontier of human behavior. That threshold, however, once crossed, was one that would forever haunt those who survived. Their agonizing journey and foray into anthropophagy is chillingly chronicled.This is a riveting and triumphant book. It is a tale richly told by a masterful storyteller, who is able to make this work of non-fiction come to life for the reader. This is simply a great book."

The one review (by a ""Top 10 Reviewer"") was written by someone with many reviews, but probably hasn't read this particular book. He goes on about how wonderful Larkin is and never mentions that THIS BOOK is not Larkin's poetry or how Swarbrick reviews and explains Larkin's poetry. Then the lone reviewer gives it a 5 star rating. Based on this, I eagerly purchased the book only to be sorely disappointed. The title made it seem like this is a compilation of Larkin's poetry and the review swayed me to making the purchase. A poetry guide without access to the actual poems is pretty useless. I am going to see if my local library has a copy of Larkin's books. Sadly, not much of Larkin's poetry is available on Kindle. Buyer beware."

This book covers all of that and more. It can stand on its own so you need not buy both books to attain a beautiful, powerful and yet simple golf swing. The photographs and illustrations are all to the point and quite helpful.The golf swing has been so hard to learn because most books deal in positions (such as straight left arms and wrist cocks) instead of simply ""feeling"" what the clubhead is doing and allowing the body to respond.I cannot recommend this book more highly.

Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character.

Although I was only fucussed on the progressing pregnancy and later the delivery/birth, surprisingly I still found myself regularly scouring this book's pages post-delivery e.g. breastfeeding, baby healthcare, immunisations, etc. A wealth of tips and resources. As well as presenting just 'medical' or 'physiological' accounts, the book also presents *practical* info, e.g. what to expect at the hospital, what to pack/bring, baby items to have ready at home, the first days after delivery (normal or caesarean), first days at home, etc. It's like having a combination of your own private midwife, and Mum, on call 24/7.

It has been a long, long time since I have wanted to actually memorize any poems, but there are many here that strike me with the same power as did the best poems of Frost, Poe, Carl Sandburg at his best, and (a special favorite of mine) Robinson Jeffers. Few more modern poets even compare in power and grace.Logan's &quot;The Crab Apple&quot; is one of the most powerful evocations of childhood I have ever read, and it belongs up there with Frost's &quot;Mending Wall&quot; and &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot; for brilliant descriptions of the subtle interrelationships of nature and people. His &quot;In the Silence of the Sound&quot; is a lyric masterpiece, as are at least a score of other poems so good it makes you wonder why the average book of poetry from a university press is even considered poetry.There are also deep philosophical poems such as &quot;At Assateague&quot; and &quot;A Short Requiem,&quot; as well as ones that carry ideas that are brilliant yet seem never before to have been expressed; an example is &quot;The General.&quot; Some of the poems are sexy, as &quot;Tango&quot;; some are plain funny, as is &quot;Mr. Success&quot; or &quot;The Traveler.&quot; Most are written magnificently well, and very, very few are dull.I recommend this book for anyone who loves literature - even for those who've never read poetry, as despite the depth of the poems, the language is surprisingly simple and the structures accessible."

You are part of something private between a father and his daughter in these stories, but, while there are a few private jokes taken directly from their lives, these do not lessen the enjoyment of the story.An example, taken from my favorite story in the collection, `How the Whale Got His Throat,' occurs after the whale has swallowed a sailor, and the sailor has said he will stomp around the whale's insides until the whale to take him back home to England.Quote:So the whale swam and swam and swam, with both flippers and his tail, as hard as he could...and at last he saw the Mariner's natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and he rushed half-way up the beach, and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide, and said, ""Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot, Nashua, Keene, and stations on the Fitchburg Road.""*****This obviously is something plucked from the life of Kipling and his little girl, so it was funny to them for this additional reason; the rest of us (including my daughter and I) still can be content with a whale doing something extraordinarily silly.Many, or most, of the stories are laced with characters and legends from India, the land of Kipling's birth, and, whether they were borrowed from Indian mythology or were created entirely by Kipling, these carried an interesting, exotic air, which I am beginning to believe I am supposed to find characteristic of Kipling. Only one of the stories, `How the Alphabet Was Made,' really dragged a bit, but even that one was all right. It was followed, though, by an exceptionally sad moment, in which Kipling writes a heart-wrenching (at least to someone with two little girls of his own) lament for his beloved daughter, who, I remember, died quite young. He uses the characters Tegumai (the father) and Taffy (the daughter), who represent Kipling and his daughter, from the Alphabet story:Quote:Of all the Tribes of TegumaiWho cut that figure, none remain-On Merrow Downs the cuckoos cry-The silence and the sun remain.But as the faithful years returnAnd hearts unwounded sing againComes Taffy dancing through the fernTo lead the Surrey spring again.Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,And golden elf-locks fly above;Her eyes are bright as diamondsAnd bluer than the sky above.In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,Unfearing, free and fair she flits,And lights her little damp-wood smokeTo show her Daddy where she flits.For far-oh, very far behind,So far she cannot call to himComes Tegumai alone to findThe daughter that was all to him.*****I sat staring at that page for minutes on end on more than one occasion, I don't mind telling you.I'm sure I'm the last person on the planet to have read this, so a recommendation isn't necessary. I will only say that some of the stories, at least, still can be enjoyed by modern children (and adults), judging by my daughter's ""can we read the whale story again...and again...and again?"" I hope that Just So Stories aren't lost over time, and I hope parents will continue to read them to their own Best Beloveds as years go by."

The description on the back cover made me pick it up (and not put it down).Though I became frustrated at times, wishing the story would progress more quickly, I'm glad I didn't give up. The end was definitely worth the wait.If you like analytical brain-candy, give this book a try. I haven't read anything else by the author, but if I come across another DAVID GROSSMAN title, I'll be sure to grab it fast!"

Back when I was first learning the craft, I often had a very alone feeling because noone around me seemed to understand what I was going through. It was comforting and inspirational to read about other people who have had similar experiences. The magic of this book comes from the insights the various authors share on how to stand up for what you believe in."

B000PY2OHI,Louis XIV,,A2A6GWP1ADFEQ7,M. A Newman,8/8,5.0,1011225600,The best of any of the biographies of the Sun King,"Louis XIV is one of those figures of history who attract a variety of biographers and who can blame them? He was king at 5 years, set France on the road to being the leading power in Europe, built Versailles, waged war against the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; (led by Winston Churchill's ancestor) and died following the deaths of most of his family. Two contemporaries, his sister-in-law, the Duchess of Orleans and the Duc de Saint Simon wrote extensively about what it was like to live within the orbit of the sun king. The gossip-packed writings of both have served to create cottage industry (at least in the UK and America) in which Louis XIV is remembered as a great figure, with a great story. However, few dwell on any of Louis's achievements (other than the construction of Versailles).This is what sets Professor Wolf's book apart from the others, for it is Louis the soldier, not Louis the lover that is explored here. If one wants to understand the workings of 17th and 18th century France and indeed Europe, one can not do better than this outstanding book. Unfortunately, this book is not widely available and this is tragic, since it is one of the best works of scholarship in the 20th century. I would recommend, if one is seeking to understand the dynamics of France and Louis (and the two were much the same during the period in question), to seek out a second hand version of this book. While the text can at times be demanding, it is well worth the effort."

B000Q032UY,The Hobbit or There and Back Again,,AP3B615GM191G,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""",0/0,4.0,1352678400,"Not Quite LOTR, But Less ""Heavy""","In evaluating ""The Hobbit"", one naturally can compare it to the later ""Lord of the Rings"" works by Tolkien. While it may not live up to that epic trilogy, ""Hobbit"" is rather remarkable in its own way: Tolkien's ability to turn what essentially was a children's bedtime story into an engrossing novel filled with adventure.For a basic plot summary, ""The Hobbit"" sees Bilbo Baggins, of Hobbiton, set off on a grand adventure in the company of Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves bent on reclaiming their rightful treasure from a greedy dragon named Smaug. Along the way, the company meets up with some eclectic creatures ranging from trolls and giant spiders to great flying Eagles and even a pathetic little creature called Gollum who is hiding a ""precious"" whose significance cannot yet even be fathomed.Whereas ""LOTR"" reads like an epic, ""Hobbit"" reads as if Tolkien is telling you a story (with both the language and tone of the book reflecting this). It is full of strange creatures and sometimes rather terrifying events, but at the same time it is rather light-hearted, with the merry gang progressing rapid-fire from one adventure to another. There is none of the doom-and-gloom or Middle Earth politics that is often the focus of LOTR.Easily the ""crown jewel"" of this novel, though, is the portion involving Gollum and his ""precious"". Whether read before or after LOTR, these scenes will stick in your mind long after anything else in this book. Much more reminiscent of the darkness of LOTR.Thus, ""The Hobbit"" is basically the ""first steps"" of the greatest fantasy story ever created. I can't rate it as better than any of the LOTR books, but if you like a lighter tone and less ""weight"" in a book, then this one might just appeal to you even more."
9993195286,Jehovah's Witnesses and the Problem of Mental Illness,,,,21/25,5.0,968284800,This is something people need to know!,"Studies have been done to prove that the mental stress put on Jehovah's Winesses cause illnesses such as anxiety and depression, just to name a few. Why could it be so hard to believe? They teach you to be paranoid about everyone around you. They tell you not to trust anyone because they might lead you astray from the society when in fact they are afraid that people will learn the truth about everything that they've tried so hard to hide and keep secret. They use guilt and fear to control people. This book tells the truth and should be read with an open mind and some common sense before assuming what you have never been a part of, never experienced, and never researched above and beyond the bounderies of what you've been taught."

The offers an exciting and concise view of the how Roosevelt established an important, if limited, role for government in American economic life.It shows how much difference one man can make to both his political party and to his nation. The book was written at a time when the legacy of Teddy Roosevelt was very much in the shadow of FDRoosevelt's new deal. It provides an intense contrast with the current, sorry state of the Republican party and national politics, in general."

The thing to remeber while reading this fine book is that the sum is worth more than the parts. Some of his ideas, mainly those pertaining to real estate investment are solid while his forays into the Dot.Com jungle are less successful. His adherance to the principle of multipe streams of income is where his true talent lies; spread yourself thin, take the risk and reap the reward.The final section of the book in which Kiyosaki hypothesizes that Marxism is going to become revitalized due to the internet is surprisingly compelling. Workers of the world, it would seem, ARE able to unite and throw off their chains, thanks to the unforseen powers of the web. You yourself may be a &quot;millenium communist&quot; without even knowing it, simply by the ways in which you surf the net."

Bookstores, public libraries, school and college libraries offer all kinds of ""how to write a mystery"" to scholarly and not so scholarly books, movies, plays, short stories, anthologies, magazines and true crime/true crime novels.. For the novice just coming to the genre this can be an overwhelming, Questions like: Who do I read? What should I read? What are differences between books by Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers or more contemporary writers like Carol Goodman and Dennis Lehane. Just reading reviews is not always the most informative way to choose. In an amazingly large novel form which includes such a diverse selection ranging from: the cozy, procedurals, cop/buddy series, lay detective's adventures, locked room, spy thrillers, romance laced ""mystery,"" historicals, sci-fi and other forms of ""mystery stories"" are different and usually each attracts its own fans. And of course, experimenting is the best guide to choosing ones' niche.Nobody, scholar or otherwise can compile a ""What Mystery Writers To Read ..."" compendium and include every writer who has penned a genre story, regardless of form.Nevertheless many such books are available and usually helpful. The ""Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing"" debuted in 1999 is still the most formidable and approachable text covering mystery writers, plots, characters, especially those who appear in a series and much more arcane tidbits. Thus at this hearty staple of the genre is a major source for Rosemary Herbert's encyclopedic ""Whodunit: A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing."" As is the way of the world her book is not an imprint of the older contribution made by the ""Oxford...."" She has courageously taken on the task of bringing a new tome that is fresh, literate and timely updated.Over the past eight years the market has been swamped with every kind of ""straight"" mysteries along with new approaches to writing them. New authors have emerged who have become stars and whose work is outstanding. Between the easy availability of books through libraries, chain bookstores, genre specific bookstores and independent book sellers mingled with the world of used material readers will gain enormous insight and information from Ms. Herbert's magnum opus: ""Whodunit A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing. Happy sleuthing!Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum."

Last time around, I awarded the latest Rolling Stone Guide one star - but this one is a completely different matter. The well informed authors have brilliantly succeeded in writing a book that will be of great pleasure to both the rock nerd and the common man. I have a few comments, though.1) You should stick to rock. I suspect that you are trying to guide open-minded rock fans into the wonderful world of jazz, but the topic is way too big and the selections will be very haphazard.2) I question the decision to give each decade the same amount of space. Surely the 60s and 70s are much more worthwhile than later decades?3) More than once I thought : ""Gee, I thought I was the only person in the world aware of this forgotten gem!"" But there is also some ugly omissions - have you ever heard about a group called LITTLE FEAT?? And these ones you should definitely hear before you die : Jack Bruce/Songs for a tailor, Family/Music in a Doll's House, 801 LIVE, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Procol Harum/A Salty Dog, Captain Beefheart/Clear Spot & Shiny Beast, Spirit-Spirit of 76, King Crimson/Red, Fripp/Exposure,Walker Bros/Nite Flights, Scott Walker/Climate of Hunter,Meters/Rejuvenation, the Searchers' late 70s albums for Sire, Richard & Linda Thompson/Shoot out the Lights, Jefferson Airplane/Crown of Creation, Ry Cooder/Paradise & Lunch, Yazoo/Upstairs at Eric's, Thunderclap Newman/Hollywood Dream, Graham Parker/Squeezing out Sparks, Bill Bruford/Feels Good to Me, Don Ellis at Fillmore, Bobbie Gentry/Delta Sweete & Local Gentry, Joe South/Introspect, Bill Withers/Still Bill, Colin Blunstone/One Year - and these are only the results of a quick brainstorming!

B000NPDZF4,The Stolen Lake,,A2R6MFHJ8CGJ06,"James Bow ""Writer, The Unwritten Girl""",12/13,5.0,997920000,Possibly the best of the Dido Twite Series,"Of the many reasons to read the works of Joan Aiken, two stand out: the irresistable pluckiness of the heroines (especially Dido Twite), and Joan's marvellously detailed alternate history of the planet Earth.An alternative history is one of the staples of science fiction. What if the Nazis had won World War II? Or what if the South had won the American civil war? These subjects have consumed many a book. But Joan Aiken is unique, in my view, because she has crafted a detailed alternate history of England and America, and has used it as the backdrop, rather than the focus, of the story. Just take it for granted that the Stuarts managed to keep a hold of the English crown. This is just one of many ingredients in Joan Aiken's stories.But in &quot;The Stolen Lake&quot;, Joan's alternative history writing is at its most creative, and that pushes its prominence forward in the book. Rather than fading into history, the ancient kingdom of Arthur and the remains of the Roman Empire stole the boats of the invading Saxons and fled to South America where they founded &quot;Roman&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Latin&quot;) America. King Arthur still sleeps, but Queen Guenivere has basically sold her soul to keep herself alive through the 1300 years, awaiting her husband's return. Into this, the young and plucky Dido Twite arrives, and upsets the corrupt regime.This only scratches the surface of the detail of &quot;The Stolen Lake&quot;. Alternative history buffs, fans of King Arthur tales, and fans of the plucky Dido Twite will find plenty to enjoy in this richly detailed tale that is a standout of Joan Aiken's books."

As you say that you are a teacher of 27 years, I am surprised by your lack of understanding character development. You must first realize that the characters all have their OWN personalities. The profanity and sexual scenes were all character driven. Mr. Tyree was only telling their stories and giving us a glimpse into their lives. Mr. Tyree is only the writer, not the characters.

Coincidently, it seems that both science and spirituality are paths to that same goal.It is a great read for anyone interested in an introduction to these issues. And will serve as a perfect springboard for more in-depth research into physics (not just quantum mechanics), and eastern philosophy."
0330346970,Albert Speer,,A263N4GO1WS7OD,Craig Montesano,16/17,5.0,1011052800,A Formidable Man Is Confronted By A Formidable Biographer,"In the course of his interviews with Gitta Sereny, Albert Speer remarked that had she been a prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, he would have hanged.How many biographers have had the opportunity to actively challenge their subjects' veracity? Not content to leave even the (seemingly) most minute details to chance, Sereny conducted exhaustive archival research and background interviews with Speer's family, friends, former associates, and enemies. This allows her to face Speer on equal footing -- and thus reveals new insights on the most enigmatic of Hitler's ministers.While the central theme of the book revolves around the question of what Speer knew about the Final Solution, and when he knew about it, the story of how one man could be almost wholly seduced by evil is also investigated. The reader will learn that Speer, unloved as a child, came under Hitler's influence in the way that many young men with lacunas in their souls will come to misidentify membership in a collective enterprise with their own self-worth.In fact, if, as William Manchester said, Speer's 'Inside the Third Reich' &quot;takes us through the looking-glass,&quot; then Sereny's book represents the adventures in Wonderland itself. The history of Hitler's Germany is seen from the unique context of the Hitler-Speer relationship. Far from relying on one-dimensional oversimplification, though, Sereny explores just how masterfully the Nazi hierarchy came to power and prosecuted a war -- proving once again that evil is not always overt and monstrous, but subtle and palliative.Was Speer a dissembler? Was he sincere in his attempt to atone for his particpation in an evil regime? I will leave the reader to his own conclusions. However, it is worth noting Sereny's charitable conclusion about this truly historical figure: &quot;It seemed to me it was some kind of victory that this man -- just this man -- weighed down by intolerable and unmanageable guilt, with the help of a Protestant chaplain, a Catholic monk, and a Jewish rabbi, tried to become a different man.&quot;This is perhaps the most fascinating one-volume account of Nazi Germany to appear in recent years, and will enrich our knowledge of that particularly dark time in history. Highly recommended."

B000P3LWHC,Spanish Verbs,,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,magellan,33/34,5.0,1071964800,Wonderful little Spanish verb book,"Please note that this is for the second edition of this book, copyright 2001. The previous edition says copyright 1990. I can't tell from the Amazon book page here if this is the first edition or second edition, but the cover design is slightly different from that displayed here from my copy, which I recently purchased, so I mention that just in case.No matter what language you're learning (unless its Turkish, which has 100% regular verbs, or Japanese, which has only two), verbs are usually a major difficulty and stumbling block in learning a foreign language. This is the best compact verb book I've seen for Spanish. The pages VII to XL (7 to 40) in the introduction contain the best capsule grammar of verbs for Spanish I've seen, and is better than the ones I've seen in some of the bigger, beefier grammar books for quickly getting a good grasp of the basics as well as the more complex issues.There are many features I like about this book, but one especially helpful thing the author does is to explain the formal grammatical names for the verb tenses, aspects, and moods and how they are formed in English, along with plenty of examples. For example, many of us have never thought of what the preterit or pluperfect is in English, but Kendris explains this along with many other useful things. Another nice feature is his discussion of how some verbs that express a mental state actually change meaning in the preterit. For example, the sentence, ""Supe la verdad,"" means ""I found out the truth."" (Saber, which means to know, changes from ""know"" to ""found"" in the preterit). And the sentence ""Pude hacerlo,"" means ""I succeeded in doing it."" (Poder, which means ""to be able,"" means ""succeeded"" in the preterit).Other features include extensive lists and coverage of irregular verbs, an index of 1000 verbs keyed to one of the models or patterns of the 300 main verbs in the text, an index of common irregular verbs identified by the infinitive, which allows you to look up which infinitive verb form it belongs to without knowing that initially, and an index of Spanish/English verbs.

This book is supposed to be a classic of the horror genre. Just about everyone agrees on that point. The negative reviews stick out like sore thumbs. Well, here's another sore thumb. The premise is great. An evil carnival comes to town and preys on the emotional and spiritual weaknesses of the residents. The problem is that the story gets lost in the enigmatic writing style that Bradbury chose for this book. Half the time, I didn't really know what was going on. Maybe I'm missing something. If I am, I'm missing it by a mile."

Simon Vance's narration was excellent, with an engaging dramatization.At a recent Bible study, someone brought up how A Christmas Carol was particularly a message about caring for our neighbors. While most of us have heard the story many times, hearing Dickens' original words really sent the message about the power and importance of loving our neighbor. While God was never explicitly mentioned, the Gospel is written all over this classic.While it is a short book that can be easily found for free, christian audio is also offering it for free for this month!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher.

Where do I start?...it leads me to ask the question, what in the world was this publisher thinking? Boettner's book stands upon the rantings of unhappy Catholics and the anti-Catholic works of people such as Paul Blanshard and his ilk. Relying upon such people is like relying upon your political candidate to tell you all the ""great stuff"" about their opponent! Blatantly unbalanced, Boettner theatricizes a parody of the Catholic view and simply refutes that. Sadly deficient.It is unfortunate that this man did NOT do his homework when writing this unbalanced work. In the words of Karl Keating, ""But he was not as interested in accuracy as in sensationalism, which is always the enemy of truth. This story is such a great blow against the Catholic Church-why spoil it with the facts?""In my fact finding perusal at the library, I came across Karl Keating's book CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM. I suggest to all who are reading or have read Boettner's book to consider the sources Boettner uses, look up the facts and read Keating's book."

He was one of the worst speakers I ever heard -- but his ideas were so incredible, so brilliant, that they shined through the poverty of his delivery. When I then went out to buy the book, I encountered the same problem: brilliant ideas, poor delivery. But the ideas are so good, it is work struggling your way through this book just to get the ideas.The idea is this: thinking and societies exist at different levels of complexity, with new forms of psychoosocial complexity emerging as lower levels become oppressive. It fits well the latest complex systems paradigm in science that takes into account emergence, information, time and process, and fractal geometry. More, it maps extremely well on to the emergentist theory of time developed by J.T. Fraser in books such as ""Time, the Familiar Stranger"" and ""Time, Conflict, and Human Values"" and in Frederick Turner's latest book ""Natural Religion"". The nested hierarchy. evolutionary, emergentist view of nature is THE new paradigm. This and Fraser's works are excellent introductions to these ideas."

A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."

B0006DYQHY,The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969,,A3C06R5OXXQ5Q7,Rather Be Reading,33/37,3.0,1073174400,Style over substance...but too bad his career ended here.,"Every serious reader of serious literature has personal favorites that aren't accepted in the general canon...which may even be hard to defend on conventional critical grounds. I myself love Luke Rhinehart's &quot;The Dice Man&quot; and Jean Stafford's &quot;The Catherine Wheel&quot;--novels that (among many others) have a certain cult following but otherwise haven't really gained any stature with time, or managed to stay in print.This is offered as preamble to another (mostly) negative review of Dow Mossman's long-out-of-print magnum opus (his only opus, in fact). The documentary &quot;Stone Reader&quot; created extraordinary expectations around this epic debut, because the filmmaker's enthusiasm about it and finding its creator after 30 years was so inspirationally passionate.So, it turns out &quot;Stones&quot; (which I happened to get in a first edition hardcover from a local library system--but only because all the recent reprints were checked out) is one of those garrulous, unfocused, under-structured gasps of &quot;writerly&quot; excess that were not uncommon in the 60s and early 70s. Back then those qualities were taken for evidence of unfettered creativity. When they occur now (see: David Foster Wallace), they can signify the same, or just an editor who's asleep at the wheel. (The latter is apparently an industry-wide problem at present--and the brilliant but undisciplined Foster Wallace is its worst-case-scenario.)&quot;The Stones of Summer&quot; is the sound of a youthful writer in love with the propulsion and lilt of his own words. Those qualities don't necessarily translate for a reader, however, and there's no question that the forced lyricism and digressive indulgence here overwhelm whatever small narrative force/character-psychological insight Mossman has to offer. Barely a sentence passes without the author describing something simple as &quot;like&quot; something meaninglessly fancier--&quot;the sun dying before them like the insides of a stone melon, split and watery, halving with blood,&quot; to quote from the book's very first paragraph. All this filigree comes at the cost of anything more involving. The author doesn't seem much interested in direct reader contact, anyhow. He's too busy trying to dazzle us.That said, &quot;Stones&quot; reveals a genuine writer--too bad he never got further chances to hone his craft. For all its indulgence, the bloated, barely interesting novel still suggests Mossman might've created great things had he stuck to it--and had the publishing industry stood behind him after this first critically-acclaimed, commercially-dire effort."

The High Window offers the standard Chandler fare of murder, blackmail and general malefaction, though its characters don't form quite as well. Philip Marlowe, the archetypical 40's investigator, is reliably entertaining, but Merle Davis, the flighty personal assistant of Marlowe's client, is so neurotic she defies description. Ultimately, she also defies the plot.It's important to point out that I appraise in relative terms. The author's previous novels were so entertaining that even the slightest Chandler misstep would resound. But, Merle Davis is a difficult proposition to get past and she eventually becomes the heart of the story.Still, it's an engrossing story and, while it might not hit the heights of previous efforts, it is classic Raymond Chandler: 40's-era LA, mystery and menace, and a cunning private eye. Because of this, it deserves to be read. 4 stars."

It begins in Kunta Kinte's small African village and the description of the very strict ways of his Mandinka tribe. It then progresses very quickly into the often horrifying story of the treatment of slaves when he is kidnapped and shipped to America. He has happy times there, but the bad ones far outnumber them.

I've read Fight Club, Survivor, and Invisible Monsters so far, in that order.Fight Club was great, but since I already saw the movie the book was spoiled for me. This upset me because of how amazing the book would've been had I not seen Fight Club (many times, too) before reading it.Survivor was good, but pretty drab in some areas. A solid book though, with some great quotes in it.But with Invisible Monsters, I was really disappointed. I'll admit the book started out strong, but then after the first 100 pages the book became nothing but a soap opera sprinkled with bits and pieces of postmodern nihilism. I got bored really fast.From the books description, the main character after a sudden freeway &quot;accident&quot; is &quot;transformed from the beautiful center of attention to an invisible monster, so hideous that no one will acknowledge she exists.&quot;This lead me to believe that the main character would have an epiphany from her experience, something that leads to keen introspective observations of a society that wants everything to be beautiful and perfect, as seen in the fashion industry, with superficiality surpassing substance. I thought it'd be a scathing satire of that very thing, but that's not what it was at all.Well, the fact that the main character had a horridly disfigured face became irrelevent to the plot. I really thought &quot;Well, what does her accident have to do with this? This is boring.&quot;So I finished it very disappointed. I lost interest 2/3rds of the way into the book, when it just became a soap opera, with it's soap opera-esque twists involving family conflict, infidelity, and transexuals. Yawn.Well, after finishing it, I'm going back to the better books I have between my book-ends, like Fahrenheit 451. But that's a classic and Invisible Monsters is contemporary fiction, so they don't compare.I still have Choke to read which I got as a present before I even started reading Palahniuk's novels, but if Choke doesn't make up for Invisible Monsters' sucking or Survivor's mediocrity, then I'll be forever turned off to him and I'll go back to reading more Vonnegut, the author he's been compared to. Contrary to what Palahniuk's critics say, I find Vonnegut to be a much more talented novelist."

The book has a good overview to energy policy and insight that a non-major science student could understand regarding the past and future energy policy in our country.This book will not only help every student and teacher to understand the problems of energy, but to help come up with possible solutions as to how these problems can be addressed. A good instructor should be able to take the information and give students insights creating thoughtful debates and the development of research projects.Energy in the 21st Century invokes the question of how do you balance our energy policies with what people perceive as reality. It stimulates the thought of balancing our country's energy policy with environmental concerns. The book doesn't offer answers to our energy concerns but gets the reader to investigate possible energy solutions.The Points to Ponder segments take science and relates it with economics and opens doors for the reader to think about how energy decisions have been made in the past and where it may be going in the future. Dr. Fanchi's book not only gives the basic structure and science of energy, but also questions were we're going with energy. It shares both positive and negative sides of the use of energy from both a science and environmental perspective. Energy in the 21st Century is well balanced in it's arguments and offers an investigating forecast into future events."

I think Montag's wife's obsession with the &quot;real people&quot; she watches is such an uncanny parallel to the reality based shows that are so popular now that it's almost creepy. The fact that it was written so long ago only adds to the impact. There is also the similarity of the viewing walls and the 56 inch high definition T.V.s of today. It's a little like a horoscope though, the reader can read more into it then is there. Ray Bradbury's past future is dreary and bleak and no one cares for anyone else. I tend to be more of an optimist, I think there are still enough people in the world that care to prevent the kind of events that happen in this book to occur any time in the near future.I don't believe the main focus of this book (as most people think) is censorship at all but rather a love letter to books and the joy of reading. Mr Bradbury writes about the joys of reading as though he were describing a flesh and blood lover. He clearly despises censorship and complacency but he gives more of his passion to the love of the written word. I think the &quot;not happy, but hopeful&quot; ending shows his faith in man.This is literally a classic piece of fiction and it's impressive how much Ray Bradbury says in such a short novel. It's easy to read on several different levels. There's almost no excuse not to read this book."

B00088BMEM,A tale of two cities,,A38HN9CD6XPMUS,Brian Pigao,0/0,4.0,1295654400,A Memorable Tale,"A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a profoundly moving novel about the French Revolution. The story takes place in both London and Paris in the years 1775-1793. The two protagonists of the novel are Charles Darnay and Sidney Carton. Charles is a French aristocrat who moved to England because of his disgust at treatment of the poor by other Aristocrats. He is honest and courageous. He is married to Lucie Manette, a French woman brought up in England. Sidney is an alcoholic lawyer who physically resembles Charles, but secretly despises him because Charles reminds him of all the successes he might have had but failed to attain. The two are friends however, because Sidney would not bear to hurt Charles as Lucie is his wife, and Sidney has a secret love of Lucie. The antagonists of the novel are Monsieur and Madame Defarge, French wine shop owners who aid in the bringing about of the French revolution and who hate Charles Darnay because he was once an aristocrat, and will stop at nothing to kill him. Other notable characters include Mr. Cruncher, a man who does odd jobs and is friends with Charles and Sidney, Dr. Manette, a French physician who is the Father of Charles' wife, and Marquis Evremonde, the rich, cruel uncle of Charles who has no regard for human life and often abuses the poor.Dickens' masterpiece exhibits external conflict, character vs. character. The characters in question are Charles and Sidney vs. the Defarges. The Defarges are so caught up with Revolutionary fever that they will stop at nothing to kill all of the Aristocrats and anyone associated with aristocrats, in this case Charles and Sidney. The crimes that Marquis Evremonde committed are enough to warrant the death of Charles in the Defarges' minds. An example of the heartlessness of Evremonde was when he was speeding down a main street of Paris in a carriage and runs over and kills a child. Instead of showing any compassion, he instructs his servants to move the child off of the road and throws a coin to the grieving parents, instructing them that he will not be so ""generous"" as to offer them any pay next time. This evil deed by Charles' uncle causes Monsieur and Madame Defarge to hunt anyone who bears a relation to the Evremonde family. After they kill Evremonde, the Defarges imprison one of his servants, Gabelle, who is close friends with Charles. Charles rushes to France to aid his friend, and upon his arrival he is imprisoned without being told his offense, and spends one year in prison awaiting his trial. This event shows the cruelty and hatred of the Defarges, and when his trial does come, he is saved only by the quick wit and silver tongue of Dr. Manette. Although they were foiled for the moment, the Defarges still had much in store for Charles, in which Sidney becomes more deeply involved, and of which you must read the novel to find out for yourself.Overall, the novel is very entertaining, with several unexpected plot twists and very detailed and beautiful language. I like the idea of the Defarge couple quite a bit, as at first they appear as if they are to be good characters, beginning the revolution against the cruel aristocrats. But their blood-lust and hatred led to them becoming evil, an event that often happens in the real world. I also found the character Dr. Manette to be incredibly interesting with his brilliant, yet unstable mind that came from years of suffering. I was also impressed by Dickens detailed description of the poor and their hardships. After further reading, I discovered that this was because Dickens himself had to exist by living on the streets as a child after his family was imprisoned for unpaid debts. I did dislike at times, however, the grim, grotesque and at times sentimental tone got a bit depressing at times. Another minor thing that I disliked was that it was told in a 3rd person point of view. Personally, I prefer 1st person, but that is merely my opinion. I would recommend that you read this book if you are interested in history or in 19th century literature."

I thought it would be an adventure story, like The Count of Monte Cristo or something of its like. As my reading progressed, it became clear to me, however, that it was more of a philosophical rumination rather an ordinary suspense or thrill book. After I finished reading the book, I've had a feeling it was more than a masterpiece--Melville had just uttered my innermost feelings through a myth, with so much life, that I could never be able to.No, the book isn't a tragedy. In the surface, you may call it that way. But more than anything, it is a Triumph. It speaks of man's upholding of his dignity amid torture in the universe. Melville gave us, implanted in us, through the most poetical language, something that we can hold onto, something that will re-reveal to us, against Gods, that we are unconquerable."

Some enjoy it, while many others dread the task of reading this ?classic Americannovel?. I can relate to many who have felt as though they would rather do anything butread this novel; I too was required to read The Scarlet Letter as a junior in high school.However, after having read through this intricate novel more than once, I believe thedread that many feel can easily be turned to fascination and interest, if this novel is readcorrectly and intuitively.Throughout The Scarlet Letter, a web of intricate plots and themes arises. In thebeginning of the novel, the reader is given a detailed description of the New Englandsetting in which the novel takes place. A series of contrasting images is provided, suchas the ?ponderous iron-work? of the prison door, and the ?wild rose bush...covered indelicate gems?. Although these images may become confusing to some, contrastingimages such as these offer insight into the characters that are described in the next fewchapters. Some of the major characters in this novel include Rodger Chillingworth, theReverend Dimsdale, and Hester Prynne. However, the protestant women described in thesecond chapter are quite frequently overlooked, yet play an integral role in theadvancement of the novel. These women are first seen waiting at the prison door forHester Prynne to exit, and are described as ?goodwives?. They are portrayed as a moredelicate and briefer beauty than their ancestors had. Characters like these women arecrucial to the advancement of the plot, but are too often overlooked. While majorcharacters are most often examined, minor characters can carry the plot in crucial ways.Utilizing complex and witty characters within the novel, such as the women by the prisondoor, adds depth to the themes, which is something Hawthorne is very good at doing.As the story line deepens, we find ourselves in the midst of a nineteenth centurylove triangle, between Hester Prynne, Dimsdale, and Chillingworth. Hester, who ismarried to Chillingworth, has had an affair with the Reverend Dimsdale. Because of thisaffair, she becomes pregnant with an illegitemate child. When the community uncoversthe sin she has comitted, she is forced to wear a scarlet letter ?A? on her breast. Whilemany believe and teach that the letter stands for ?adultry?, it can be argued that the ?A?stands for something other than this theme.When Hester leaves the prison, she is described in a completely different mannerthan the women who awaited her at the prison door. In the second chapter, Hester isdescribed as ?...tall, with a figure of perfect elegance, on large scale?, which is starklydifferent from the description of the other women. The ?A?, in this case, could mean?admirable?, or even ?American?, unlike ?adulteress?. I have not heard this optiondiscussed or even acknowledged; it is only insisted in high schools that the ?A? onlymeans one thing, even though it is never even stated what the ?A? stands for.One of the biggest misses in the high school teachings of this book is the absenceof the Custom House Essay in the course syllabus. In the Custom House Essay,Hawthorne lays the plans for the entire novel. He carefully describes the New Englandtown he grew up in, and offeres readers an inside look at the men who worked in thecustom house. While never stating his dislike for these men, Hawthorne uses ironicdescriptions of these men to give the reader a true depiction of the leaders of their time.The Custom House Essay also contains Hawthorne?s definition of a ?romance?, anddescribes for the reader how he created the novel. Hawthorne appeals to the readerssenses by using both fiction and truth in this preface to his novel. It sets the stage for therest of the book, and plays upon the idea that the ?A? on Hester Prynne?s chest couldstand for more than just an adulteress.One of the major downfalls to The Scarlet Letter is the language style used in thebook. At times, certain words can be hard to understand, and the language used todescribe the setting can slow down the reading of the novel. However, this is not thefault of either the writer or the reader, because this novel was written in nineteenthcentury America, which is quite different from the world we are living in now.One of the biggest problems a reader could surface from reading the novel is theunderrepresentation of women and minorities. While the novel is centered around awoman, she is not given a distinct voice in the story, nor is she represented by a woman.She is forced to live on the outside of town, and is forced to wear a letter ?A? on herchest. When confronted by her husband Chillingworth, she is not even given the choiceto acknowledge him as her husband. Instead, she is told by him that she should notreveal his identity to anyone.Not only are women underrepresented, but minorites as well. There is nomention of any African American people in the novel, yet they were quite present innineteenth century America. The only minority mentioned is the unnamed Indian, wholike Hester, lives on the outskirts of town.Although certain aspects of the novel can confuse and hinder the reader, TheScarlet Letter is a novel which transcends time and location. It has become a majorAmerican novel not just because it was written about American life, but because itsthemes question what it truly means to be an American. I highly recomend reading thisnovel, and stronly encourage readers to include the Custom House Essay in their reading.Whether it be the first time, or one hundredth, The Scarlet Letter carries themes whichremain prevelant throughout American literature."

And so, a sequence of events unfolds like dominoes unleashed with a single push. The story is both beautiful, remarkable and tragic with moments of happiness and moments where you just want to hit yourself upside the head with the book.

The 224 page book was published in 1971. The story includes Poirot's friend the mystery author Ariadne Oliver ( who bears a close resemblance to Agatha Christie).The book is narrated in the third person. It is always delicious fun when Poirot and Oliver join wits to defeat crime!Plot: Ariadne Oliver the famous crime novelist is attending a literary party. She meets the obesely odious Mrs Burton-Cox. This grand dame informs Ariadne that her stepson Desmond is planning to wed Cecilia Ravenscroft. Desmond is the son of Kathleen Fee who was the mistress of Mrs. Burton-Cox's first husband. Fee was a wealthy actress who has died leaving a large fortune to DesmondBurton-Cox wants Ariadne to investigate Celia' background. It is believed that Miss Ravencroft's parents committed suicide. Another theory is that Celia's father Sir Alistair Ravenscroft killed his much younger wife Molly or she murdered him. The murderer was then believed to have killed him/herself The unsolved case occurred some fifteen years prior to the novel's action.Ariadne refers to persons who worked or were otherwise acquainted with the deceased Ravenscroft couple as old elephants. This is because Oliver hopes those she interviews have good memories like elephants! Ariadne and her friend Hercule Poirot visit these characters hoping to learn more details about the murder/suicide. We learn of the romantic triangle involving Sir Ravenscroft and the twin sisters Molly and Dolly. Dolly has spent time in a mental institution. She was living with her sister and Sir Alistair at the time of the tragic deaths. Dolly is thought to have murdered a child in India as well as her son. Four wigs and a dog bite will clarify the crime.Though a very late Hercule Poirot novel I thought this entry in the Christie canon provides a good read. It is not one of her greatest mysteries but is a good solid read. Well done Dame Agatha!"
B0006AQFR6,"Orthodoxy,",,A1WPFIZ8P3O86V,Phil in Magnolia,2/3,5.0,1314403200,Outstanding book; Excellent quality edition by Torode Book Arts,"Recognizing that Chesterson's Orthodoxy appeared in numerous lists of ""books to read"", and granting the premise that it is therefore a worthwhile book to obtain, I decided to get a copy and give it a try. Immediately, the question became - which version to purchase? I quickly found that on Amazon there are no less than 45 paperback editions available (some are almost certainly duplicates, but still), and 12 hardcover versions. There are even 6 different Kindle versions!Such is the quandary for books in the public domain; every print-on-demand operation can offer it up, and how do you know which ones are good quality and which are not? I have read enough Amazon reviews complaining of poor quality books, some that seem to be scanned and not proof-read and thus contain numerous spelling and other errors, others missing entire pages, that I was very very hesitant to try anything other than an edition from Penguin or Oxford Classics or other comparable reliable publishers.When I discovered this ""Centennial Edition"" (good marketing, that), and did some checking, I was satisfied that it was worth trying out. I have not been disappointed. I have the book in front of me as I type this review, and I can report that it is a very good quality book, well produced, and to me it is indistinguishable from a book printed by a ""traditional"" publisher. This is not a bare-bones, simple printing of the book. It is perfectly typeset, well designed and attractive, and with a very nice style to the production. It is in all respects completely satisfactory.If you are looking for an edition of Orthodoxy, that is a reasonably priced and high quality paperback, I can recommend without hesitation that you purchase this edition.(The publisher, Sam Torode Book Arts, is not shown by Amazon as the publisher; rather ""CreateSpace"" is listed, as they are the print-on-demand publisher utilized by Torode. There are several other books by Chesterton available on Amazon that are produced by this same designer/publisher. I have no association with that company, I can only say that I would expect that the quality of those books would be the equivalent to this printing, and they would be equally worthy of recommendation.

Many of the asanas are also appropriate for intermediate or advanced students. For me, attending a yoga class once a week and using this book as a supplement to home practice works well for me.Some people think of yoga as simply a physical discipline or another way to work out. Not so, because its emphasis is on not straining, not rushing and not competing. It is a system of helping the body become more flexible and promoting physical health, but it is also a way to know the self, transcend the ego and become enlightened, among other things.My primary focus right now is the physical training (hatha) aspect of it and gradual learning and practice of the spiritual aspects of it. That's just my preference and each person will approach it in their own way. I know I will refer to this book again and again."

Still she cannot help but get involved when her sister Leah Miller is the prime suspect in the murder of her nasty spouse Bob, a Republican politician. Adding to the noise, Bob's biological family blames the media of being suckers about the African-American Jewish Leah; in fact his sister is just short of accusing Leah of committing the homicide of her ""beloved"" sibling.Unable to stay on the sidelines, Sophie decides to get involved though it means raking the deceased over the coals for his hedonistic lifestyle. Reluctantly she obtains the services of the most detestable delectable private investigator she knows Anatoly Darinsky (come to think of it the only sleuth she knows. Anatoly agrees to help while the police detective in charge Lorenzo warns Anatoly to watch himself. Together Sophie and Anatoly begin to make inquires starting with Bob's three mistresses and his profligate spending on costly luxuries mostly for his other women.Once again, Sophie's undeniably implausible schemes make for a fun whodunit with a delightful romantic subplot. The story line is humorous as Sophie's plots go awry and the eccentric appealing yet obviously caricatures augment the City by the Bay joyride. PASSION, BETRAYAL AND KILLER HIGHLIGHTS is a fine lighthearted chick lit mystery.Harriet Klausner"

B000HNPFSC,Ulysses (International Collectors Library),,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,DonAthos,48/75,1.0,1111708800,A Difference of Opinion,"Random House, calling on English Professors and other literary professionals, declared James Joyce's Ulysses as the greatest novel of the 20th Century.Who am I to disagree?While I may not have too many initials following my name, I'd like to believe that my opinion about Ulysses is valid in its own right. After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the ""word overture."" At the beginning of the ""Siren section,"" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a ""genius."" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel."

It is bitter, without hope, and depressing, but it wakes people up and hopefully makes them think &quot;why&quot;. I read this book two years ago and it has not left me since.

0897334264,Threshold Of Fire: A Novel of Fifth-Century Rome,13.95,A55B9VCC7F2ZL,SkookumPete,10/10,4.0,1123200000,The fifth century from the inside,"Perhaps because I was expecting something like herIn a Dark Wood Wandering, an epic tale that spans decades, I found this hard going at first. What, a historical novel that is scarcely more than the troubled thoughts of one man, and the scribblings of another? But by the time I was finished, I felt that I had experienced something really unique, and I'm certainly going to read this book again to extract more of its richness.The story focuses on two characters: Hadrian, the chief magistrate of Rome, and Claudian, the greatest poet of the age. Of Claudian's life we in fact know little, other than that he hailed from Egypt, had a meteoric career writing panegyrics and invective for the court, and then disappeared from view around the time that his patron at court, Stilicho, was executed by the emperor. For the sake of her story, Haasse assumes that Claudian's origins were humble, that his success was largely due to the help of Hadrian, and that he has lived illegally in Rome for a decade after his fall from court favor. She also postulates that he is fundamentally sympathetic to the pagans, who by this time must practice their rituals in the utmost secrecy, on pain of exile and confiscation of property. When he is implicated in an illegal rite, he appears before the magistrate, and the story is about what happens between them, and in their thoughts, over the course of a day.Although this is very much an ""interior"" sort of book, the sense of historical reality is very strong indeed. As much as I have studied this period, I have never felt such a vivid sense of what it was actually like to be alive then. The religion that defined the state for centuries is now a hole-and-corner affair; Rome is still under the shadow of the Gothic sack that took place a few years earlier; actors who formerly packed the theaters are reduced to playing obscene mimes at private parties. Claudian, living furtively in a tenement, typifies the coming state of classical civilization itself.There are lapses. One of the remembered characters plays chess, a game that was certainly not invented till two centuries later. The magistrate cites the Theodosian Code -- the law he refers to exists, but the codification didn't come until later. These are, however, minor quibbles. The historical foundation is firm, and the insights are profound."
B000J33RXK,Slaughterhouse-Five,,A90NWGGUDQ78O,Tom Lombardo,0/0,5.0,1288396800,Anti-war Classic,"Vonnegut's mother committed suicide, and Vonnegut himself was prone to severe depression, but it was his experiences in World War II that had the most dramatic effect on American letters. Marching across occupied Germany in December 1944 -- six months after the Allied D-Day invasion -- Vonnegut's Infantry division was pressing the advance into German-held territory when he somehow became separated from his comrades. For several days he wandered alone behind enemy lines until he was discovered and captured by Nazi troops on December 14. They transported him to the ancient and beautiful German city of Dresden, where he was imprisoned in an underground meat locker -- Slaughterhouse Five -- with six other Americans.On February 13th, the 60th day of his captivity, Allied forces began the legendary fire-bombing of Dresden. Generally speaking, Allied bombing raids targeted German infrastructure -- especially anything having to do with manufacturing or transporting munitions. If they knew the geographic source of munitions, they would obliterate the entire area -- this being decades before satellite surveillance and ""smart"" bombs. The bombing of Dresden is something of an anomaly in the Allied efforts: there was no manufacturing to speak of in Dresden, so it was not really a ""rich"" military target.It was, however, in a little valley, and over the course of the bombing, which went on without pause for two days, the bombs and the fires they started changed the weather in the valley; it became a chimney of sorts, sucking fire through it, and the destruction of Dresden was nearly as complete as was the destruction of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, the Japanese cities incenerated with atomic bombs the next year.Vonnegut witnessed the whole thing, and survived. After the bombing stopped, the Germans had their few remaining prisoners gather corpses until this proved futile; they then went in with flame throwers and reduced the civilian dead -- numbering in the tens of thousands -- to ashes. In disarray, the Germans fell to the Soviet Union's troops three months later, and Vonnegut was liberated.This series of experiences fed into all of Vonnegut's writing, mostly in the form of a grim appreciation for the way an idea, social or scientific, can take on a life of its own, and demand that it be completed, no matter what the consequences. Most of his novels involve events that hurl forward even when no one seems to know why; they just accept it and deal with it. Regarding the bombing itself, Vonnegut once wrote, ""There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.""Vonnegut was prolific, writing essays and stories throughout his life. He was also a tormented soul who once tried to commit suicide, but after his death at 84, in 2007, his friends and family mostly remembered his warm humor.Considered a classic of twentieth century literature, and included in both Time Magazine's and Modern Review's list of Top 100 Books , Slaughterhouse-Five showcases the idiocy of war in an original and darkly humorous way -- a feat that few authors have ever been able to accomplish. The story seems funny because it has no linear time line, and thus no ending; Billy Pilgrim, the main character, has ""come unstuck in time"", and he experiences times of his life -- and death -- in random order.Pilgrim survived the WWII bombing of Dresden in a meat locker, of course, called ""Slaughterhouse Five"", and his experiences in the war are juxtaposed with his marriage to the obese daughter of the optometrist he works for and with his drunken, late night attempts to re-connect with people who long ago forgot about him. He has also been abducted by aliens from the distant planet Tralfamadore, where he is kept on display under a geodesic dome in a zoo, making love to his fellow captive, the movie star Montana Wildhack, as the aliens watch in fascination.Throughout much of the novel, Pilgrim is deranged, either from shock at the horrors he witnessed in the war, or from the disorienting effect of being unstuck in time. At the end of the book, as an old man, ruminating on the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and distressed by the carnage of war in Vietnam, the time comes for Pilgrim to go public with his ""unstuck-ness"". He does so on the radio, which makes him out to be an old fool. But the reader knows better. We know what he's talking about; we know what's happened to him. Pilgrim is not un-stuck in time; his world is un-stuck from morality."

Everything from the writing to the concept it embodies had me positively spellbound.This book is about a dispossessed earth-man named Arthur Dent and the tremendous effect he is having on the universe. After narrowly escaping from the destruction of the Earth with his friend Ford Prefect whom he had believed to be from earth but turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the area of Betelgeuse, they travel around the galaxy together meeting up with a large ensemble of friends along the way. The whole series of books follow Arthur Dent's journeys around the galaxy taking him to many mysterious places such as the ancient planet of Magrathea, and to a very strange planet named Brontital in a synthetic universe in one of the offices of the MegaDodo Publications (the home of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) on Alpha Centurai. And also to pre-historic earth to see the cavemen wiped out by a bunch of telephone sanitizes.The whole series is completely astounding and to think it all came out of the mind of Douglas Adams; the creator of the television show, the radio show and the author of all five novels.

This book has it ups and downs. I think that the only way that you would be able to enjoy this book is if you start thinking deeper into the story. I liked this book because you can think deeper into it and it makes sense and it explains a lot. If you think deeper into the story then you can enjoy the book so much more.This book is pretty much a allegory book. An allegory is a story or tale with two or more levels of meaning-a literal and a symbolic meaning. The characters in the book stand for something else. This is a hard book to understand for that reason. Once you thin it through and think of what the characters could be resembling then you can understand the book more. I didnt understand the book until my teacher started telling the class that the characters stand for something or the symbolize something and then I understood it and got into it a lot more.So if you are looking for a book where it gets you to think and it has a deeper meaning then this is the book for you.

Ms. Potter adapted the screenplay from Virginia Woolf's 1928 novel Orlando: A Biography about an individual who changes genders halfway through her over four-hundred year long life. The movie is divided into seven sections: Death, Love, Poetry, Politics, Society, Sex, and Birth.Excruciatingly slow and cryptic, Orlando is nonetheless a gorgeous work of art. Its enthralling music, mostly composed by Ms. Potter and David Motion, contributes to the film's dreamlike ambiance. Orlando's color palette is also extraordinary. Cinematographer Aleksei Rodionov shoots the Rococo period's pastel blues and pinks in muted light. Candles illuminate the Renaissance's bold outfits and elaborate rituals.Tilda Swinton looks the part of the androgynous Orlando, but the movie's acting and writing are stilted and bizarre. Amongst the film's many unsubtle messages, its most powerful theme is that of identity. Though difficult to get through, Orlando has an entrancing originality."

Evey book I found seemed to offer tasty looking but heavy, heavy solutions.

There is lots of background information on preparation, finding and choosing ingredients, and many other interesting sidlights. The pictures are gorgeous and a big help in choosing and putting toghther the dishes.To me the strength of the book is that once you get the hang of the way to cook Chinese dishes using little or no fat, you can modify and extend any receipe you come across in the future using the principles used in this book and know you are eating food prepared in a manner that is healthy.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""",4/4,5.0,1288656000,"Uneven and unpolished, but still superb (details)","There are two primary facets of this novel, for a novel it is in terms of many of the fictional characters:1. The author artfully places his finger directly on the pulse of Russian culture and society during one of this nation's most turbulent periods, an era of infinitely morphing politics and attitudes. The absolute Monarchy of the Romanovs was crumbling as acts and thoughts of revolution spread pervasively through the chatter of young ideologues. Solzhenitsyn probes the internal activities of a few Russian families (one of which is clearly autobiographical) where characters holding various political views manifest and begin to develop.2. Chiefly, the book is all about the first two weeks of World War One from the Russian perspective. A protagonist of sorts eventually emerges from this diaphanous yarn, Georgii Vorotyntsev, an intelligent and pragmatic Russian colonel who is highlighted by his shrewd judgment and his justifiable pessimism.Of course in retrospect, we know that the Russian invasion of East Prussia [Germany] commenced like a ball of fire and then swiftly reversed itself into total disaster, mostly due to centralized military ineptness and wishful thinking by The Tsar and his dull-witted appointees. The inability of the Russian army to adapt strategy and tactics to the ever changing battlefield resulted in their early demise and continued to plague them throughout the war. In the story, Colonel Vorotyntsev attempts to effect early corrections but blind stupidity at the very top effectively bulldozes his most valiant efforts.World War One was one of the stupidest wars ever fought -- it was initiated at the behest of out-of-control egos of the competing monarchs and as inconvenient treaties and alliances between these respective countries expanded the conflict into a global event. All concerned fully expected this war to be a brief one but of course, this was not to be and consequently millions were slaughtered, soldiers, sailors, and civilians alike.The author wisely remained un-diverted by the complex causes of the war, steadfastly focusing upon his literary agenda to particularly describe events. He took on specific developments of the war's early period and ultimately yielded up the amazing minutiae of these events, fictional to some degree but still fairly accurate, much in parallel with how Tolstoy'sWar and Peace (Modern Library Classics)fictionally but precisely detailed Napoleon's invasion of Austria and subsequently of Russia.From the beginning, Solzhenitsyn notes that he'll likely not finish this story in his lifetime but he clearly wanted to get a lengthy prologue of sorts into print, at least in part. Some of his characters are left hanging and we wonder what becomes of them. He even retracts a particular chapter [Chapter 22] for reasons which the reader remains uninformed. Solzhenitsyn's attitude comes through as, 'Something is better than nothing at all'. I wholly agree in this instance, especially since what he did yield up over these 622 pages is notably compelling.It's not unusual to encounter unfinished works by noted Russian authors -- we see it with Pushkin but probably the most widely-known example is that of Gogol's masterpiece,Dead Souls: A Novel; however, I consider that we are blessed that all these significant, if incomplete tales, made it into print. Of course we additionally thankfully later get the author'sNovember 1916: The Red Wheel / Knot II.For all its warts [chiefly in the form of omissions], *August 1914* makes us drool a bit for more, thus the five stars which I have awarded this superb work. Michael Glenny's translation is articulate and flowing so that the reader might garner the entire scope of Solzhenitsyn's insightful writing. The maps located on the inside covers are indispensable -- in their absence most readers would be lost.For any enthusiast of either Russian novels or for rabid war historians, I most emphatically recommend this superb fictional [and yet true] book.[NOTE: If you are especially interested in further exploring classic Russian literature, I have posted a couple of Amazon *Listmania Lists* on this specific topic -- just go to my profile and click on *Listmania Lists*]"

I discovered this book while chaparoning a Christian youth gathering three years ago. At the time, my girls were 15 and 18. I purchased it for them, but out of curiousity read it myself as well. WOW!! I have purchased several copies and I give them out to my daughters' friends (boys as well as girls) and my single adult friends. Incredibly sage advice for those looking for a mate, but a great guide for teens just entering the dating world. Although you may not be ready to settle down or even have a serious relationship, this book offers a frame work you can use to help you avoid becoming too invested in an individual with whom you are not ""equally yoked"".

There are crucial lessons here, whether or not you believe the actual experiences that happen. Through his relationship with Don Juan, Carlos Castenada reminds us of how truly mysterious the world is, and how much awe and wonder there is in ourselves, if we are brave enough to be willing to see it.The book really has very little to do with peyote or drug usage persay, it has much more to do with questioning the very foundations on which we base the world to become aware of reality. Not one that has been dumbed down by definition and categorization but experienced as it is. I see a direct link here with &quot;I Am That&quot; (a book of talks/interviews with an Indian Guru), and even The Matrix.But the sense of power in nature and the drawn out detailed depictions in nature are like very few books I've ever read.This is a great book for an English Class, Existential Philosophy, or Cultural Anthropology, and I do not see this is as a work of fiction. At the very least it is an invitation or reminder for us to rediscover the magic in our own lives again.It is a thoroughly enjoyable read - suspend your analytical mind for two hundred sixty pages and enjoy."

In the story friends have to trust friends to be able to stay alive. The author ( J.R.R. Tolken ) makes you feel like you're in the story, and you can picture what's going on. The story is about a hobbit who lives peacefully in his little hobbit hole with no intention of ever leaving it. But one day a wizard and dwarfes appear at his door wanting him to go on a dangerous adventure with them. At first he says no to the idea, but once he finds out how much gold is in it, he just can't resist. He and the dwarfes face many dangers. What I learned from this book is that you need to be brave and that it doesn't hurt to try new things because you might like them. I think that everyone who likes stories with dwarfes, wizards, dragons, and lots of excitement and suspense should read this book."

Because it isalso a book about abortion, it also touches on an issue thatis incredibly hot in America even as abortion has becomean uncontroversial fact of life in most of the rest of theworld.So it is a tribute to the author's scholarship as well as tothe scope of his world view that he stays true to the businessof explaining a Japanese Buddhist take on the world withoutovertly indulging in taking sides in the American controversy.It' a tribute to his depth of understanding that in spite ofthis lack of partisanship, this splendid book has something toteach us all and some light to shed on the American debate.It would oversimplify LaFleur's arguement to sum it up, but onethread is something like this. The Japanese view of a newbornis that it is a potential life. This view is even more emphaticin the case of an unborn-a foetus. People become people inthis view by a gradual process of socialization.Rather than being heartless, this way of looking at things hasa great deal to recommend it-especially in days when infantmortality was high. Parents who lost a new-born or an unbornchild could pray for the return of that child in a subsequentpregnancy. The ritual system, which provided no funeral forone who died so young, affirmed the tentative nature of thedead one's membership in the human community.If it takes socialization to make a human and a family to makesocialization, then it is also up to the community and thefamily to decide if that's going to happen at all. In thisview, life in infancy is a liquid that hardens into indiv-iduality with time.So infant death and miscarriage are sad, but not final. Theunborn child gets to come around again, maybe with better karma.This, of course, removes abortion from the realm of murder/choice. It also forces all of us to see our various positonsin the American debate as products of our social and religiousassumptions just as the Japanese view is the product of theirs.Again, this is not a book about the American abortion wars.It is instead, a splendid book about Japanese religious beliefsacross a swath of history and how they affect attitudes. Bystaying true to his topic, LaFleur teaches us a great deal.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN9781601640005"

I opened it up the box only to find that it had been bound incorrectly. I took a look at the binding, and placed it in my hands with the ""Green Lion Press"" symbol facing upwards (so it could be easily read) and Euclids Elements reading from top to bottom. However, when I opened the book, after passing a few blank sheets I found the final page of the book upside down! This cannot be the standard for Green Lion, although it is very amusing. I almost think, I may not make a written complaint because there must only be a batch or so of this edition crafted in this obviously novice manner (and so I feel special). My imagination forces me to believe they had a first day employee loading up the binding machine -- he was probably wearing jeans.Has anyone else had this experience?"

That alone stirs up many thought-provoking issues, like how an Asian American girl attempts to find her identity, or the similarities between Jewish and Asian Americans. That alone would have been enough. The problem is that Jen adds a lot more to her plot. A little too much maybe. On top of the Asian American issues, you've got your 70's zeitgeist, black American issues, hippies living in teepees, and generation gaps. It almost seems like Jen is making a bold attempt to create the Great American Novel--encompassing each and every ingredient of the Salad Bowl, aka America. But the book is so all-encompassing that Jen hardly gets truly in-depth into anything. The Jewish Asian girl premise is lost within the first fifty pages, and maintained periodically by half-heartedly throwing in a few Yiddish phrases through the rest of the novel. Because of it's broadness, this book does not bring up as many Asian American issues as one would hope. It's a worthy competitor for the Great American Novel title, but unfortunately, Jen isn't much of an established writer outside of the Asian American literture realm for her book to be considered for the GAN pool."

B000HC8GT8,Of Mice and Men,,AOGLOD55SNLD7,"David Lupo ""David Lupo""",1/1,5.0,1266883200,The Odd Couple: a tragedy.,"Here is another classic that slipped by me during my school years. What a powerful novel. It's hard to find this sort of caliber fiction in the popular market today. In a time of early rugged individualism, in the years of the Depression, here come Lenny and George. They are an oddity to the field workers they join to garner a living. It is all too transparent that the clumsy, oversized, highly-challenged Lenny needs his pal, George. He is lost without him, a walking tragedy that needs constant monitoring. What is less clear is why George continues his relationship with Lenny. Often George ponders what life might be without him. Might it be that rugged individuals experience a loneliness that is too painful?Steinback's novel reads like a stageplay. One cannot differentiate the description of props from the description of experienced reality. Outside the text of the powerful drama, Steinbeck ends a chapter by context, noting a truck's passing on a distant road, or the noises of animals outside. The result is fascinating, enlarging the drama, and including the reader therein. Some years ago I read ""Cannery Row"", but I only vaguely remember it. This work will stay with me.The characters are real, walking into the barn, and the play right off the fields as Steinbeck studied them; Slim; Candy; Crooks: Carlson. Of course, there has to be Curley, let alone his nameless wife. They all knew she was trouble, except Lennie. And therein lies the tragedy. A mouse? No problem. A puppy? Hmmm. A woman? Big problem! The tragic ending severs a relationship. But Slim offers hope, another chance.A wonderful, powerful story of the human condition."

I think it is better balanced than many of its competitors in the sense that the reader never gets the impression that the author sacrificed certain subjects to give more room to his favorite ones. On many occasions, I was surprised to find things in here that I couldn't find in the bigger (and more ""fundamental"") Alberts and Lodish.It references papers and review articles that are very current, and is very up to date on its content.I think Gerald Karp is doing a very good job with each new iteration of this book and I will recommend it to my students."

1900621606,A World of Fine Difference: The Social Architecture of a Modern Irish Village,,AWTBPIRJA2XIS,A Addicott,0/0,5.0,1011571200,Unique anthropological study of coastal Irish village,"A World of Fine Difference has been written by an anthropologist who has somehow managed to combine the discipline of his profession with the role of community member, always aware that he is a blow-in and therefore not a true member of the community because he does not possess the necessary local knowledge that would give him the cultural capital he needs to share the sense of place, identity and belonging of the native-born. This may seem an irrelevant point, but it is not. Until you understand why place, identity and belonging are so important to Irish people you will never be able to understand the Irish psyche.Peace calls his study village Inveresk - &quot;the inlet of the fish&quot;. It is a fictional name, as are all the names of the people and some of the other places in the book. It does not matter that Peace cannot identify the actual village, because the social patterns he describes resonate through much of Irish life, rural and urban. Given what he has explained about diversity, Peace is at pains to stress that his study community is unique - hence his &quot;world of fine difference&quot;. The members of Inveresk also see themselves as &quot;a different place altogether&quot; from neighbouring communities, which in turn see Inveresk as &quot;a place full of really queer people&quot;. But Inveresk is not one community, it is three closely-knit, diverse communities; Peace describes them as country, village and pier. Where Inveresk may differ from other similar coastal fishing and farming communities is that each lives cheek by jowl, with the country folk no further than a few miles removed from the pier folk.In Inveresk, Peace shows a community that has no desire to live up to the caricature that rural Ireland is dying or losing its cultural identity to modernity. He writes: &quot;Despite the extent of this sustained induction into modernity, Inveresk retains a strong, indeed pervasive, sense of its own distinct identity, of being a special place in the world. Notwithstanding the many external forces which threaten to breach and subvert it, this sense of distinction is articulated with pride and the residents work hard to sustain it.&quot; So this is a book about a &quot;special&quot; community in rural Ireland, a community that is determined not to lose its distinctiveness, despite the external forces ranged against it, and ready to subvert the very forces that would destroy it for their own ends.Peace argues that the unique community factors which make Inveresk a &quot;special&quot; place may save it from the fate befalling other similar coastal communities. There is, Peace contends, evidence that &quot;recent technological, economic and political developments have encouraged rather than eroded the expression of cultural&quot; diversity, hybridity and creolisation, even if the people of Inveresk themselves are not convinced of this. More significant, Peace argues, is the reality that this small community of 450 adults is aware of possible entrophication, so much that there is a deliberate and conscientious desire to keep &quot;alive the sense of belonging to this particular place at this particular time&quot;. In this regard, Inveresk's strength is the &quot;fierce spirit of egalitarianism&quot; and &quot;almost remorseless opposition to political hierarchy&quot;. In modern Ireland, with few exceptions (Arainn being one), that is not only unique but amazing.In Peace's words Inveresk is &quot;a modern place in a late modern society&quot; yet sadly perhaps &quot;also a distinctively peripheral locale in which, one presumes, the negative effects of global marginalisation should be especially pronounced&quot;. There is little argument that &quot;the inhabitants of Inveresk share a sense of powerlessness in relation to the politics of government concentrated in the metropolitan core&quot;. However that has not stopped this small community of 450 adults from consciously and deliberately attempting to reshape their own small world from within their local environs while keeping an eye on what is going on beyond. As Peace notes: &quot;They may not be successful in some of these efforts; a few may have no impact at all, but that is beside the point. Far from their locality 'moving away from their feet', they remain firmly in command of it and they are proudly aware of the fact.&quot;"

Shortly after the marriage, his in-laws. and many others in the vicinity of the port, died from disease brought by a plague ship, but Hywel and his wife survived and even performed some of the necessary governmental functions during the emergency. Some five years later, Angkor became a hub for interstellar trade in that sector and the Jern business thrived through Hywel's many off-world contacts, both legal and illegal, but he maintained a low profile, operating from the same modest hock-lock.One day, the first officer of a space liner brought in a ring with a dull stone that was found in interstellar space, far from any star, on the finger of a space suited corpse. The crude stone is plain and cloudy, but has a remarkable hardness. The stone gives an impression of great power to Hywel and Murdoc, but not to the rest of the family. Hywel is obsessed with the stone and arranges an apprenticeship for Murdoc with Vondar Ustle, a master gemologist who searches for new sources of precious stones, so that Murdoc can search for more information on the ring and stone. Hywel is well satisfied with his life as apprentice to Vondar and, when he returns for a visit, finds that he no longer fits into his family. One evening, Hywel stays home to conduct some business while the rest of the family goes to a party. Leaving the party earlier, Murdoc returns home to find his father tied to his chair, bloody and dead. Murdoc takes the ring and stone from its hiding place and leaves his home forever.In this novel, Murdoc and Vondar have come to Koonga City on Tanth searching for gems. They are dining in a taproom when the Green Robes, native priests, enter, spin their selection wheel to point between Murdoc and Vondar, and try to take both men. Murdoc kills one priest, fights his way clear, and then finds sanctuary with the priests of Noskald. These priests arrange for a Free Trader, the Vestris, to take Murdoc off-world. The crew treats him in a distant, but civil manner, but his only companion is the ship's cat, Valcyr. When the ship sets down on a primitive planet, Valcyr accompanies Murdoc as he explores the area. When Murdoc finds some bits of a curiously dull black substance that forms an extremely hard but fuzzy oval, Valcyr takes the largest specimen and starts to lick it. Murdoc tries to take it away from her, but gets clawed for his efforts. When a crewman tries to get the specimen, Valcyr runs off with it and hides. Murdoc and the crewman find her again, but she then swallows it.When they return to the ship, the Medico tests Valcyr and the specimens; he determines that the black ovals are alive at a low level as if hibernating and that Valcyr is now pregnant. Since there is a possibility that Valcyr is not carrying ordinary kittens, she is locked in a cage within the sick bay. About four weeks later, she disappears from the cage and is next seen in Murdoc's cabin with a newborn animal, Eet, that is not a kitten. And then Murdoc finds himself covered with purple blotches and feeling feverish. At this point, Murdoc and Eet leave the Vestris, Murdoc in a spacesuit and Eet in a clear-sided box, to escape the plague-fearing, frantic crew.This novel has some of the signature characteristics of the author's space adventure tales, including the outcast Murdoc, the telepathic Eet, and alien artifacts. The creature Eet is rather unique in the author's space adventures, having a human level of intelligence, yet possessing an animal body.Highly recommended for Andre Norton fansGunner, June, 2009"

I didn't think the framing story was necessary; it has no bearing on the individual stories and drops out of sight till the end after the first few anyway. I'm not sure why the author chose to use this particular device at all. In any case, this is an anthology worth picking up. There are several gems."

The author does a great job explaining how horrible the conditions are when you're sitting hundreds of feet down on the ocean floor in a dead submarine hoping that someone on the surface can find and rescue you before your oxygen runs out or you freeze to death.The book really shows how a few ingenious American heroes overcame huge obstacles and saved the lives of sailors who surely would have perished if it were not for their quick thinking.I really enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who is as interested US Submarine history.

The story begins with Mihaly and his wife Erzsi on their honeymoon in Italy. Mihaly reminiscences and tells Erzsi, who believes her husband is extremely mysterious and strange, about his childhood. Throughout his adolescence, Mihaly is confused about his infatuation with his best friend, Tamas, and homosexuality comes into question along with death and a second birth.During his stay in Ravenna, he is found by an old friend, Janos Szepetneki. This unexpected run in with Janos somewhat inspires him to leave his wife, unintentionally, and goes on a journey where he runs into old friends and manages to transform his psyche. This novel is complete with love, passion, bewilderment, adventure, heartache, and secrecy. And, above all, a graceful acceptance of common-day reality. I give it five stars."

As many of the inhabitants of rural America--especially in the South and Appalachia--are of Scotch-Irish descent (many of my own ancestors included) it is natural to expect that the American revival meeting might have its origin in Lowland Scotland. I also found that these Scottish ""Holy Fairs"" were ridiculed by the poet Robert Burns in his poem ""The Holy Fair"", as can be found inPoems and Songs of Robert Burns. Indeed, Burns considered such gatherings to be an assembly of hypocrites who attended these meetings in order to arrange assignations with the young women attending such events. Of course Burns (the sire of numerous illegitimate children) was all for debauchery--just as it was indulged in a way that was free of pretense! As I continued thinking about this aspect of religious revival meetings I remembered the section of The Grapes of Wrath in which Tom Joad encounters Jim Casy, who had been a revival preacher in Tom's youth. Casy tells Tom about how he would bed young women in the grass after they had been excited by such meetings, which seemed to have acted as a sort of aphrodisiac. In Casy's confession to Tom he worried about his own hypocrisy in those days--leading those girls into sin just after exhorting them to shun such encounters."

Daley gives us a look into Han and Chewbacca's early smuggling career and takes them from caper to caper and thrill to thrill in the Corporate Sector Authority (nice change from the Empire, by the way).""Revenge"" the second book in the trilogy, sends Han and Chewie battling slavers with his droid friends Bollux and Blue Max (who are waaayyyy more interesting and likeable than Threepio ever was!). Perhaps the best thing about these novels is that there's none of the whining that pervades so much of the later saga, and Han's wisecracking one-liners are priceless. Daley definitely had a feel for Our Hero, and gives readers a breathless adventure that's more than worthy of the Lucas originals. A pity these never made it to film. Highly recommend!"

B0002E5QM6,Maisie Dobbs,,A3PHF9UV3F177L,Julia Flyte,1/1,3.0,1305590400,The introduction to a promising series,"This is the first book in a series about Maisie Dobbs, a private investigator working in London in 1929. It's a gentle read that reminded me of the books I read when I was a teenager. Indeed in many ways it feels like a young adult novel. The characters and their motivations are spelled out for us and there are few surprises along the way. It's easy to compare it with the No 1 Ladies Detective series, but it lacks the whimsical charm of those books. Nevertheless it's an atmospheric and enjoyable story that's reminiscent of Kate Morton crossed with Agatha Christie.The plot is partially about Maisie's life story and how she evolved from a domestic maid to a private investigator. It's also the story of her first case, which involves investigating a retreat for WW1 soldiers who are struggling to fit back into society after the war. There's an intriguing mystery but it really only comes to the fore in the final third of the book, once we've dealt with all the back story. The changes in English society and the impact of the first World War are central to the story and make the book very interesting. Maisie also carries psychological scars from the War and over the course of the book she will need to acknowledge those.Maisie uses psychological techniques to solve her cases. For example she frequently mimics people's body language to get an insight into how they are feeling. She also has a ""sixth sense"" about how things will work out. To be honest, I found this less than convincing. However by the end of the book I was really enjoying the story and I'll definitely pick up more in the series."
B0000EDSNP,Why Things Always Go Wrong: The Peter Principle,,AHT3C1S89P5JX,Ami Vider,2/2,5.0,1326758400,There is something you can do about mediocre people!,"Lots of people said how great this book is, how it's relevant to every area in life. I first read the book over 20 years ago. While starting out as a manager, people noticed that even ""mediocre"" workers under me were treated like others. In electronic design, work has to be done correctly and checked to assure absolute specification correct design. It's a kind of job like many where not only accuracy is crucial but team work is what makes a product work. While the basic idea of being promoted beyond your ability makes logical sense, this is not what I was seeing. People with some training in a certain area could keep on ""going up the ladder"" and take more responsibility or do different type of work. My sense is that ""The Peter Principle"" is a first step in managing careers and people's work. Once you see someone fail at a certain task or area of work, then comes correction. I guess today we are more aware of what Peter has said.A different issue I saw and I still see every day, is the ""hire me I got an MBA"" (or an MS in Electrical Engineering, or Finance, etc.) or ""hire me I have done all the elements of the job in my previous life"". This is The Peter Principle without history in the same company or department. It's incompetence at the first step of the ladder. This seems to be a much bigger problem as you hire high level executives. I have seen this in CEOs and just today I have seen it in a senior exec at a new start-up. Amazing stuff... Peter did see and explain lots of interesting behavior in the corporate working world. Read it once, than read it a few more times... NICE reviews, Amazon really has a great service with customer reviews."

It successfully exposes that it is a *false* choice to insist that life forms *either* evolved *or* were designed.The book is comprised of three sections. The first develops a context for the essays that follow, touching on historical, scientific and exegetical elements relevant to the discussion. Part two provides an extensive summary of current scientific evidence and thought on the developing cosmos, the changing earth, and biological evolution. The third section focuses on philosophical and theological issues that are frequently cited in the current debate.The writers come from a variety of disciplines in the scientific and theological communities. They include evangelical Christians at secular universities and at well-respected evangelical institutions (for instance, Wheaton College, Messiah College, Calvin College).Though it is a rigorous book, and sometimes a difficult read (depending on the reader's background in science and theology) I *highly* recommend this book for all those seeking truth about the world we live in and the God whom we serve."
B000JDVR14,Enchantress From The Stars,,,,3/4,5.0,1146355200,Best Sci-Fi Book,"When Elana's mission gets put in jeopardy she faces a lifetime of torture and imprisonment. Will she be able to save herself and the mission? Elana, the Enchantress, and her father were agents of the Federations Anthropological Center and it was their assignment to stop the Imperials from taking over the planet Andrecia. They led Georyn, a woodcutter's son, to believe that a stone was the source of his new magical powers; however, the truth was that they had taught him telekinesis and he wasn't even aware of it. Georyn was supposed to use his ""magic"" to defeat the dragon (a mechanical weapon used the Imperials). Elana and Georyn were on their way to the Imperials camp when natives captured them. The natives took them to the Imperials camp where they were locked in barracks. The Imperials planned to send them to a research center to be studied. Elana persuaded one of the guards, Jarel, to help them and he let Georyn out of his cell when no one was paying attention. When it appeared that the dragon was going to defeat Georyn, Elana decided to sacrifice herself to try to end the whole ordeal. As she ran and laid in front of the dragon, a flood of courage surged through Georyn. He used his magic powers to save her, stop the dragon, and scare away the Imperials. Georyn went to the king to announce that the dragon had been killed and to get his reward. He decided to explore the rest of the planet he lived on while he had the chance. Elana left Andrecia after accomplishing her goal and traveled back to her own planet. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading a great book.This book is written with loads of details. Georyn was the youngest of four sons born to a poor woodcutter, who lived on the planet Andrecia. Elana was a young woman in the First Phase of her training to be an agent. Jarel was an Imperial medic who was determined to prove that his civilization was not right in trying to colonize Andrecia.Even though this is a science fiction book some of the things in it are realistic to our own world. The cool, green, peaceful planet, Andrecia is the third planet of a medium sized yellow sun. The Federation tried to prevent weaker nations from being taken over by stronger nations. Some types of people tend to be better at some things than others.This book will stretch the reader's imagination. The Imperials used a huge machine that resembled a dragon to clear an area on Andrecia for the colony they were planning to establish. Georyn was taught telekinesis on a subconscious level, therefore he didn't even know about it. The Federation was an organization meant to save weak planets from the more powerful ones trying to colonize.I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great read. It is very imaginative but some of the elements of the book seem somewhat realistic. Even if you are not a big fan of science fiction books this is a story that everyone should read.~V. Newberry"

B000GNZX58,Assassin's Apprentice,,ATZLB28PRJPL8,The Evil Hat (evilhatDOTblogspotCOM),0/1,4.0,1284249600,A Review for the Trilogy,"""All too often I find I have wandered far from a history of the duchies into a history of FitzChivalry. Those recollections leave me face-to-face with who I once was, and who I have become.""Robin Hobb is, in many ways, a one trick pony. Wait, wait! Don't leave yet. I don't mean that in a particularly negative way. There's nothing wrong with the majority of her style; it's just utterly overshadowed by one aspect. She has less in common with a dog standing on its high legs and more in common with a dog learning to drive a racecar.As anyone who's ever read Hobb can likely attest, her strength is not plot. Farseer's plot is, ultimately, fairly generic. There is an abandoned bastard son, brought to the castle to serve as an assassin. There are three brothers, two honorable and brave, one spiteful and cowardly. There are barbarian raiders from another land, and there are magics both old and very old. Have I intrigued you yet? No, I thought not.Her strength is not setting. We're in the Six Duchies, a confederation of six former states, all ruled under one king. The coastal Duchies fish; the inner Duchies farm. There is conflict between the two; the coastal Duchies are reluctant to pay taxes to defend a coastline they do not share. It's thought out better than most of its ilk, I'll admit, but it's still not exactly the kind of thing that you view with your jaw on the floor.Robin Hobb's strength is character. It's not an intellectual strength; I'm not talking about revolutionary backstories, or motivations, or anything like that. Her strength is visceral. These people feel real in every way possible. We see Verity trying to fill his older brother's shoes, trying to guard the kingdom. He does everything he can, and he is wasting away, and it is not enough. We see him, and we know that he cannot succeed, and he knows he cannot succeed, and yet he cannot - will not - stop.Fitz is the main character, the aforementioned bastard son of Price Chivalry. He has a depth that can only be had when the reader experiences his growth alongside the author, alongside the character. When we first meet Fitz, he is a blank slate:""My memories reach back to when I was six year old. Before that, there is nothing, only a blank gulf no exercise of my mind has ever been able to pierce. Prior to that day at Moonseye, there is nothing. But on that day they suddenly begin, with a brightness and detail that overwhelms me...""It's said that our experiences shape us, and so it is here. We experience everything that Fitz does, and so is it that surprising that we are shaped in the same way the he is? In book one, we see Fitz develop loyalties in friendships. In book three, these loyalties are tested. The reader cannot look on with detachment, cannot wonder if he will stand fast or not. There is no intellectual contemplation, no thoughts that he should simply bite the bullet and move on. By that point, it is not Fitz that is being tested, at least not wholly. The reader is invested along with him. Every bond that Fitz forges is shown with meticulous detail, and the reader himself becomes friends with Prince Verity, Molly, and Burrich. These friends may not speak to us directly as we read, but there interactions with Fitz are, on every level that matters, interactions with us.We become so deeply immersed with Fitz that his reasoning becomes our own. I would wager that everyone has had the unsettling experience of having someone tell us our own motivations and realizing that what we thought we were acting for was just blissful, comforting delusion. It is the same experience when Fitz's motivations are called into question. Acts that felt so pure at the time are suddenly given new light, and we feel almost sullied as we contemplate them afresh.A large portion of your enjoyment of Farseer depends on how much you like to meander. Hobb is anything but direct. I've heard it said that her writing is eighty percent filler, and it's hard to really dispute that claim. All the same, I think that it's the so called filler that makes Hobb worth reading in the first place. The reader lives through Fitz's life, and I do not mean just the important moments. No, the books - and Hobb - shine through the monotony of day to day existence. If you are willing to simply cut yourself loose, to lose yourself in Fitz's existence, you'll find yourself living a life no less complete and complex as your own.I suppose that that is, quite literally, escapism. All the same, I've never understood the term completely. It's defined as: ""Habitual diversion of the mind to purely imaginative activity or entertainment as an escape from reality or routine."" I suppose I can't argue with that, but the term seems to far more often carry a negative connotation. I've often heard it said that it's taking refuge from the real world. Ignoring the tone of the novel in question, something has never struck me as accurate about this definition. Just because what we're doing does not directly tie into our own lives, why is it inherently meaningless? I'm not defining meaning as a simple recharging of the batteries here, either, though it can do that too. But books can do so much more. Who says that, just because the terms in question are not those of the real world, we are not learning, are not experiencing?Besides which, if I was going to escape to somewhere else - a Hawaiian vacation for the soul, say - I'd make it somewhere les depressing. The titles and covers all seem quite carefree, but the actual text is anything but. This is, despite all appearances to the contrary, anything but standard fantasy. We are in Fitz's head for his triumphs, yes, but also for his tragedies, and we feel both with equal force. Just because Fitz tries something, and just because Fitz is one of the ""good guys,"" does not mean that he will succeed. Be prepared for disappointment of the most bitter flavors while reading.""'I always believed, perhaps childishly, that if you followed the rulers, you would be protected, that things like that would not happen to you. Afterward, I felt...tricked. Foolish. Gullible, that I had thought ideals could protect me. Honor and courtesy and justice...they are not real, Fitz. We all pretend to them, and hold them up like shields. Against those who have discarded them, they are no shields at all, but only additional weapons to use against their victims.'""Of the individual books, the first is at once the one with the fewest flaws and the weakest. The second, by contrast, has glaring problems, and yet it's undoubtedly my favorite. The first book lays down the connections, and it is half the size of the others. It's not focused, no, but it never meanders too much, and we always have our ending goal in sight.The second, on the other hand, is almost nothing but meander. It's an attempt to preserve the status quo as seen in book one, but for half the text exactly how we're doing so is quite hard to see. That being said, Hobb's writing gets better as it goes on, and every interaction between Fitz and another character only makes the overall story that much deeper.The third novel is an odd mixture of the two. It should, by all rights, be the most driven. A goal is immediately established, and Fitz sets out to accomplish it. Perhaps because of this, it's the first time where the repetitive nature of the story began to become somewhat irksome. When there's no set destination, I'm fine with exploring every little town that I pass on a long drive. When I'm late for something, however, I'm far more tempted to ram the pedal to the ground and get somewhere. This is not an urge that Hobb shares, and the cycle of Capture-Escape goes on to the point of insanity. At which point we're finally given a break, and the book takes a hard right turn. Everything changes, and it's at once totally brilliant and anything but. The ending is powerful, yes, but also rushed. As it is, it's a decent closing to a brilliant series, but it's impossible to shake the feeling that it could've been an amazing ending.If you're looking for something exciting, or something uplifting, Farseer is not for you. This isn't about a gripping plot or fascinating locales. This is about people living their lives, and, though it's fantasy through and through, Fitz and Hobb's other creations feel as real to me as anyone I know. If character driven is what you're after, I'm not sure it's possible to do better than this."

B000C1JK1W,Watchmen,,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,Theo,2/3,5.0,1281312000,Truly Deserves its Legendary Status,"When reviewing a work of the caliber of Watchmen it is genuinely difficult to know what to say - except that its cyclopean reputation is entirely deserved.I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'm going to keep things abstract. Watchmen simultaneously deconstructs its own genre while giving voice to one of the great ""absolutes"" of literary fiction: the human quest for morality and meaning in an inherently meaningless and amoral universe. Perhaps this latter aspect explains why the aptly named ""Rorschach"" has become so iconic of this work as a whole.Amazingly, Watchmen achieves all this while simultaneously spinning a superheroic epic that easily holds its own against anything you're going to find in the latest avengers/xmen/blackest night/justice league cosmic crossover.Speaking of Justice League, it's interesting to think about just how much the Project Cadmus storyline inJustice League Unlimited, Seasons 1-2 (DC Comics Classic Collection)owes to Watchmen. Indeed, I find that I can't help but draw comparisons. Justice League Unlimited is most certainly its own show, and by no means a slavish remake of Watchmen. Yet both, in their own way, take a long hard look at the myth of the superhero and ask us if this is really something that we would want. Certainly, it can be no accident that in the Project Cadmus story, The Question takes the central role that he does. In Alan Moore's original proposal for Watchmen, the role ultimately filled by Rorschach was then taken by The Question.But where the Project Cadmus story arc races headlong towards the edge of the abyss only to back away at the last second, explaining with an apologetic cough and a nervous giggle that really, it's only a children's show after all, Watchmen careens off the edge of that abyss at full speed without hesitating for so much as a heartbeat. It leaves us suspended anchorless mid-air, entirely on our own in our attempts to re-orient ourselves as we hurtle directionless through this new void.One final point: I'm writing this review for the softcover edition of Watchmen. Personally, I own both the basic softcover edition and the and hardcover version of the ""absolute"" edition. The latter of the two contains a lot of interesting extras, but at the same time, it's really too large, heavy, and unwieldy for comfort. It's a great coffee table book, but it's not something you want to just lie back and read. For that, I'd definitely recommend the softcover version.Theo."

1568581971,Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman 2 Ed,13.5,A7KQIW7G6WLXP,Ragnus,7/8,4.0,1106870400,Interesting read,"I came of age in the late 80s and the first time I heard of Abbie Hoffman was in a Rolling Stone article on the 20th anniversary of Woodstock. According to David Fricke, Hoffman was clubbed with a guitar by the Who's Pete Townshed after the former took the mike during the lenthty ""Tommy"" medley and spouted some obscenities in the crowd, saying that Woodstock was a ""bunch of s--t while John Sinclair rots in prison."" I next encountered this character when I read about the Chicago 7 trials, when Hoffman and his co-defendants made a mockery of the trial (and what gleeful mockery it was!) and the judge who was handling that controversial case.This book reveals much about who this sixties firebrand was, what drove him to do what he did, how the US government responded to sixties radicals like him (with hammer and tongs), and why he would eventually choose the life of an outlaw. Sadly, it also provides some valuable insights on why Hoffman would eventually take his own life. To his credit at least, he never became what he hated, something that cannot be said for the rest of his generation."

The stories he discusses in this memoir range from his life altering realization of his homosexuality, to the time his family took a prostitute into there house for Christmas. Sedaris effectively presents his stories by artfully putting his own morbidly humorous spin on many situations that would make any normal person shudder. In the hospital where he volunteers, after observing the patients who was in the mental ward he writes, ""I wanted to slam heads against the wall and scream, ""Stop acting like and idiot and get better goddamnit!"" Then I'd notice the bruises covering their bodies and realized that someone had already tried that approach. (79)""The most redeeming and interesting characteristic of this entire novel is the organization. Each chapter is a separate story. Sedaris opens each chapter with a completely new subject yet manages to cunningly tie up all the stories and conclude the story at the end of each chapter. He may have done this in order to parallel this memoir to life, which he feels is made up of millions of little stories. However completely absurd these stories are he still manages to make the reader believe them by incorporating excellent detail and authentic characters.I really enjoyed this book because of it's the author's humorous voice and his ability to keep the reader entertained throughout the entire book. It was one of the best novels I have ever read and would recommend it to anyone who wants to know how lucky they are to live with the family they do.-Mike L."

Consequently, it contains strong recommendations as to fitness levels based on detailed, researched forms of exercise. All the major types of exercise are charted against fitness level and age.Surprisingly, for a fitness book, it contained recommended restrictions on exercise as well. Cooper still advises on the lecture circuit that if you are running, at his chart levels, for more than 7 miles/week, that you are doing this for other than cardiovascular reasons. In other words, this is the optimum amount of exercise for relevant cardio fitness, all further exercise having marginal cardio benefit. NONE of this ""go to the burn"" stuff. Quite the contrary, controlled escalation of workouts.Sadly, it wasn't long before Cooper had to back away all his quantitative recommendations -- or lose all to the shylocks and their crony judges.Still, the best work published on exercise form, age standards."

I am increasingly unhappy with Pete Marino's character. His paranoia and persecution complex have gotten much worse and, frankly, a bit worrisome. As another reviewer wrote, he's become a caricature. Hope Cornwell provides him with an attitude fix before he crosses the line and ends up in serious trouble of his own.Predator (Prefrontal Determinants of Aggressive-Type Overt Responsivity) is Dr. Benton Wesley's latest research study at McLean Hospital (an affiliate of Harvard Medical School) in snowy Boston where he studies the brains of violent killers/sexual predators to see how they are different from normal brains. His primary subject is Basil Jenrette, killer and sexual predator extraordinaire, whose murderous history is appalling for even this psychologically thick-skinned, world-weary forensic psychiatrist. Basil is talking, perhaps too much. When very strange, terrifying and murderous events in Florida begin to have a Boston connection, Basil's history and that of another seriously disturbed person take on new light and greater dimension.Meanwhile, long-time colleague and now lover, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, our heroine, is working at the National Forensic Academy, funded by niece Lucy Farinelli, in balmy Hollywood (FL) where she becomes involved in the mysterious disappearance of four people from their home with no apparent evidence of foul play. Thrown into the mix is the murder of one Dr. Johnny Swift, though its relevance to me at the end is a bit tenuous; and creepy Dr. Joe Amos, who I suspect is mostly a red herring. Marino's in Florida, too, as an employee of NFA, although it might be better if he were elsewhere. He's more of a hindrance than a help most of the time. Lucy, whose relationship with her aunt is always a challenge...pretty much her own doing, is struggling with a number of issues and some rather bad news. The story is certainly terrifying when one considers the evil it portrays, but the end was disappointing in that it came too fast and left some other plot issues at loose ends.Carolyn Rowe Hill"

McClellan,3/6,3.0,1161820800,Plodding writing but a gripping story,"My wife and I listened to the audio version of The Innocent Man during a recent cross-country trip. Grisham may write compelling fiction, but here his writing style is pedestrian and repetitive--perhaps due to the fact that he conducted the research and wrote the book in only 18 months, according to the author's note.Fortunately for readers, the story of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz is so compelling that it soon overcomes the shortcomings of Grisham's telling. The two men went through hell, and Grisham ably documents the incompetence, arrogance and maliciousness of the Ada police and prosecutors and the lack of concern of the Oklahoma criminal justice system. Grisham does not soft-pedal the dark side of Williamson's character and his slide in and out of madness. Yet by the end we marvel at his ability to survive as well as he did given his severe psychological problems.The Innocent Man is a harrowing and cautionary tale that should make all Americans concerned about the fairness of a justice system we usually take for granted. Although Grisham may not have been the best writer to tell the story, his fame at least guarantees that the story of Williamson and Fritz gets the attention it deserves."

0517699427,Oscar Wilde,,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,David Bonesteel,2/2,5.0,1105228800,Insightful and tragic,"Richard Ellman's fascinating biography follows Wilde from his beginnings as a brilliant student to his tragic end, when he haunted European locales that had delighted him in better times like a living ghost. The early part of the book is the least interesting. Wilde was one of the first useless celebrities-figures who gain notoriety simply because something odd or appealing about them keeps them in the public eye apart from any actual talent (although Wilde was, by all accounts, an excellent speaker). Ellman's analysis of Wilde's aestheticism is, I suppose, essential to a complete understanding of the man, but since the matters that Wilde devoted so much of his energy to were so frivolous and trivial, it doesn't make for a very good read. Later, though, Wilde demonstrates his talent with the publication of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and his successful plays, and the biography picks up as well. Wilde becomes a truly tragic figure by the end, ruined by his love for Lord Alfred Douglas, hounded by Douglas's father the Marquis of Queensberry, imprisoned, and finally betrayed and forgotten by most of his former friends. For all his wit and insight, Wilde emerges as a curiously nave character and basically a good man, kind and trusting to a fault."

B000KISQC6,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies",,AVVAEBP8KUEFO,Harrison Wong,1/1,4.0,1293926400,"Interesting, tedious, interesting, tedious","Guns, Germs, and Steel is an excellent book with pros being that concepts are easy to understand, many examples that the concepts are applied in, and ultimately the ideas make sense while the cons being just repetitive and tedious at times.Most of the ideas and concepts that Jared Diamond introduces and explains is easy to follow. Jared Diamond first proposes questions of why things happened in history and then goes about answering it in, on average, twenty page chapters that introduce different ideas and patterns with explanations. He then ties these ideas and trends into a logical way that helps answer the question posed at the beginning of each chapter. If you are not an expert or have extensive knowledge in these fields, then expect to find this book very enlightening and agree with most of Jared Diamond's ideas.The next positive thing about this book is that it has an abundance of examples to look at. The purpose for the examples that Jared Diamond includes after each concept introduced is to further convince the reader that his views are correct by aiding the reader's learning in the new concept introduced by seeing it in action. But as I read further into the book I started to question whether his concepts are universal or only applied to the examples given, which can lead to some controversy. But nonetheless, the examples given was key to convince people to believe his ideas.An important good thing about this book is that the ideas introduced in this book are believable and makes sense to most readers. This connection with the reader is the most important thing that the author can do. In this book, basic concepts are introduced and progress throughout the first half or so of the book. Understanding the basic concepts, such as the roles of food production, domestication, and geographic location in affecting human society's development that are introduced in this book, helps the reader understand the book as a whole along with the main idea of the book which is Diamond's thesis that peoples on different continents histories are different because of environmental factors.The only negative thing that I am able to say about this book is that at some points in the book the reading becomes repetitive. Many basic ideas of the book are repeated many times in this book which makes it hard to read sometimes because it feels like you are wasting your time. One repetitive thing that comes to mind is the idea that food production allowed specialization and all that other good stuff that allowed the formation of a complex society. But despite the tedious parts of the book, Guns, Germs, and Steel offers a load of interesting stuff. I am sure that there are other negative stuff about this book, but that would require that I be an expert in these fields to validate the information that the book provides.In conclusion, Guns, Germs, and Steel is certainly an excellent read that brings many new perspectives and ideas that one might have never though of before if you are not an expert in these kind of fields. Although I would rather not read this book again, I definitely recommend this book to any person out there that is learning about world history."

He's using half of it for two doughnuts and a glass of water when a man comes into the cafe looking for wheat-harvest hands, at $5 a day for drivers, $7 for pitchers, and as high as $8-$9 for stackers. Ralph has never stacked wheat, but he's pitched plenty of hay, so he bluffs his way into the stacking job. He soon learns that he and the rest of his employer's new crew--a stranded medicine-show ""doctor,"" a dried-up little old man, two great hulking Swedish blacksmith brothers, two Denver U. college boys, a Mexican teenager and a chunky little Irishman--have signed up with the boss from hell. Myron Hudson is a hard-driving, hard-swearing man who's rough with his stock and rougher with his wife and five small children; only his young sister-in-law Judy seems willing to stand up to him. He has such a terrible reputation in his own neighborhood that he has to cross the state line to hunt hired hands. After years of successive crop failures as a tenant farmer he has finally moved about as high up on the dry divide as he can get and still be on the planet, and he's mortgaged to his neck. Ralph resolves to help Mrs. Hudson and her children and makes a plan to do it, but after only one full day on the job Hudson is killed by one of his own horses. Now Ralph no longer has to sneak around behind his back to put his plan in motion, and he steps in and takes hold like a born CEO. Working out a deal with the banker who holds Hudson's paper, he not only contrives to bring in all of Hudson's wheat, but sets up a regular business hauling that of other farmers to the elevator, a task requiring split-second scheduling and perfect teamwork. The respect he shows his fellow team-members makes them his loyal followers, and three months later he owns eight teams of horses, the rigs to go with them, and over $1300 in profits stashed in the bank, and has his eye on some cattle-land to set himself up in ranching.Perhaps only in the early 20th century could a scheme like Ralph's work out so well, but without his own native gifts, the skills of his team, and the vision of a shrewd (if not always completely trustworthy) small-town banker even he couldn't bring it to fruition. Here we see how the lessons he learned from his parents, his grandfather, and his past employers stand him in good stead. This is the conclusion toward which he has been moving ever since his family first settled in Colorado a dozen years before, and in true American-dream style he has made it from hardscrabble farm boy to about-to-be landowner before he's even old enough to vote. An inspiring American story."

I read Jane Eyre twice and comprehended every word, every nuance. Wuthering Heights was another matter. So much of it was obtuse. Just a little while ago, I read a very helpful review here by an English teacher no less, who said he had trouble comprehending the story the first time around, but he has read it again and this time it was a completely different and positive experience for him. I certainly have benefited from this particular review because now I am going to read Wuthering Heights again with a different attitude. It is not easy reading; it is a deep book. You have to concentrate, but I know I can do it, and I am going to do it! Even though I saw the movie before I read the book (I thought the movie starring Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier was outstanding), parts of the book were still obtuse. If I hadn't seen the movie, I suppose the book would have been a total imposssibility. I don't mean to seem so negative about Wuthering Heights, but I have never in my life read a book where I had to concentrate so much; it took the pleasure out of reading it."
0425105709,"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (Hercule Poirot)",,A3K1RVYM3JQZZS,Ricky Hunter,1/1,4.0,1127779200,Interesting Set-Up,"One Two Buckle My Shoe is one of the more contrived of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels but its twisted loops are definately part of the fun. The author does play around with politics in her conservative, often very naive, way but handles it much more smoothly than she did in her early twenties spy novels. The solution to the killer is both predicatable and satisfying as Christie crawls right up to the preposterous and then pulls back just a little. This is one of the Poirot novels that could have used Hastings a foil and his prescence is sadly missed, particularly as everyone at a certain dentist's office on a particular morning has something to hide and it would have been fun to read Hastings switching prime suspects with each new revelation. All in all, not a classic Christie but an interesting one."

Having been a fan since 1976 it seemed like a way to find out more about 1 of 3 musicians making up the band called &quot;Rush&quot;. The members of Rush have always been out of the public eye, as least from the view point of this American living just 90 minutes away from them. So as a result, we have had to come up with our own perceptions of what this trio is all about. These perceptions, however, have nothing to do with reality. This trio has never consider themselves rock stars, in the true since of what we feel that means. And have always put themselves out as musicians first and foremost, which is part of the attraction to some of us...myself included. Having said that, what is the point of reading this book? The lyrics and music represent what this band wants you to know...whether this is what we want is not the point...whether this is perception or reality is not the point. It would be nice to learn more...but with that comes risks. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up listening to their CDs and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - only to discover that you will NEVER know how deep the rabbit-hole goes anyway...because...that's how it is...that's how it's going to be.Life is about love...and loss...I only wish that I could take off as Neil did to contemplate my existance the last 2 years.

Proust may &quot;recapture the past&quot; through memory, but Franzen portrays the everpresence in our lives of events and dispositions (which in part are created out of events)that linger below the surface.Having recently plowed into Gravity's Rainbow and stopped halfway through because I could not justify the toil of reading it in light of the jewels I was supposed to unearth, I find it refreshing to be able to read a book that does not require me to order chaotic episodes, yet which has more than a story to offer. Franzen's writing does not cloud the plot line with verbal ostentation. Yet it lends fresh insight into personal and collective living (outer and inner) in modern America. Many people will mine gems from this book. I left it to eat, to go to work, and to exercise. Otherwise, it was a continuous read."

The seven sisters seemed to lose the individual personalties and depth of character previously established in other works. Here they were nothing more than the seven sisters, each running around saying &quot;yup, I'm a chosen of Mystra.&quot; Further, the events of the book made the characters seem very shallow, two-dimensional and empty. They were more representations of their archetype, not characters. It seemed as if the author was far more interested in writing the book than developing the characters or story. As a big fan of the Forgotten Realms world, I wish that this book had not been written. The author was clearly trying to evoke emotional responses of fear and potential loss (the deaths of the chosen) in inapropriate ways. With or without the power of Mystra, none of the chosen would have lived that long or risen to those levels of power by throwing themselves carelessly into such danger. Mages of such tremendous power and resources would not have come so close to death in that manner. While I have enjoyed many of Ed Greenwood's contributions to the Forgotten Realms universe, this one I consider a dismal failure."

Consequently, most of the literature that I have read on the subject (written during the height of Iraqi Archeaology in the 1920's and 30's) has been on a religious note rather than a historical one. This book changed all that. It brought a highly academic subject to the layman. It is a simple, informative account of how the real Babylonians lived. It describes the Babylonians as an advanced people who appreciated art and literature, as well as entering into contracts and having mortgages. It is a great introduction to an ancient civilisation."

Anthony,1/2,5.0,1301443200,An American Classic,"I'm fifty years old, I've read literally thousands of books, and I'm not aware that I've ever read a novel written by John Steinbeck. Recognizing this deficiency, I ordered a Steinbeck collection, seven of his most celebrated works including The Grapes of Wrath. I vaguely recall seeing the film starring Henry Fonda, and am well aware of the plot and the historical backdrop, but nothing can take the place of reading the work itself.As most know, the book details the westward migration of the Joad family, as they are uprooted from their Oklahoma homestead by the evils of the Great Depression, the Oklahoma dust bowl and the advent of mechanized farming. The family harbors visions of milk and honey awaiting their arrival in California, or so they are assured by the numerous handbills promising plentiful work and bountiful riches. What await them instead are rapacious labor recruiters, unfriendly natives and slow but sure starvation.Steinbeck certainly succeeds in painting a vivid and stark picture of the hopelessness faced by the migrants. His chapters alternate between ""big picture"" overviews and the particular heartbreaks and hazards faced by the Joads in particular. The story is an education in economics, labor relations, politics and human nature. In this day and age, it is difficult to conceive of children literally starving to death in the shadow of the most productive agricultural land in the country, much of it lying fallow and off limits to those that were capable of growing the food to nourish their own families.This is a very powerful novel, both with regard to the emotions that it taps and the beliefs and conceptions that one holds. It provides a sharp contrast between a period when so many were desperate to work for as little as something to eat, to one in which so many demand so much without having to lift a finger. There must be a happy medium."

Some of you might actually think me naive or just a hopeless romantic but I truly expected Lord Carlton to marry Amber, at least some day when they were 90 something like that. Getting to the basis of my review, from which I have drifted, the book is just as intriguing as any contemporary historical romance novel it seems to be the foundation for all those great historical romance novels that are hugely popular today. It has rich descriptions and truly gives the sense of one actually living in 17th century London. Amber is a great character and I was rooting for her from the beginning, we all have a little side of Amber's evilish thoughts. On the other hand the book is too repetitive, two bad husbands is enough in my opinion, and most times I had to put it down just to simmer my anger at Bruce for being so cold to her and at Amber for being too pleading with him often asking myself ""where's her pride when she needs it?!""So basically my disappointment is that Amber got greedy and Bruce got married and even more cold towards her, and they didn't end up together. I was also disappointed in the fact that throughout all the novel I saw how Amber rose above all obstacles and later she gets tricked because of her only weakness, the novel completely lost oomph for me I wanted her to rise above EVERYTHING including Bruce. And finally the only thing that I would criticize about Amber's attitude is that she wasn't such a devoted mother, I don't know but my maternal instincts kicked in and I kept wondering about her kids all the time, and Lord Carlton was always a bigger priority than them.Still got to say props to Kathleen for writing such an amazing book (which is today considered a classic) in such a conflicting time for women specially. I give it 4 stars for the ending, but truly i have read worse, much much worse, its pretty good!"

I disagree with the political statement but the description of the thought process that Clancey uses is remarkable. I think that he shows a great deal of understanding of the thought process that other people use. The level that he is able to accomplish this is remarkable .The story though far fetched is excellent. Of course the idea that somebody would drive an airliner into a building was bit far fetched not so very long ago. The technical detail that he describes the weapons with is wonderful. It is interesting to hear about the same weapons on the news every night.I did not find this story as spellbinding as some of the other works I have read by Clancy but it is still a better book to buy than most of the entertainment books out there.I wrote the above before I read the other reviews. I would caution the potential first time buyer if all you get out of this is an American, Russia, Chinese comparison you ain't paying attention. The nationalities aren't representative of races as much as they are thought processes. And they are foils more than reality. This book is not about America versus them.

The author's access to intimate details of Parker's youth made for compelling reading, especially the macabre accounts of Al's losing his virginity to a knife-wielding psychopath! Al's experiences at Woodstock were a hoot. I also found the story of his entry into the porn world with the encouragement of his lover to be very interesting. I had always imagined Rip Colt to be as hot as the men he photographed. What an eye-opener that was!The background info on the films themselves was very welcome to an aficionado like myself. I've seen them all a hundred times and the insider gossip and behind-the-scenes details make for interesting reading.Most of all, I was delighted to discover just how ordinary this sexual icon of gay liberation really was. To know that he was involved in a serious relationship that spanned fifteen years, all the while fueling fantasy fires across the gay spectrum was quite a turn-on for me. It was also gratifying to read about his pioneering efforts in bringing safer sex to the gay, X-rated video screen.While checking out this site, I couldn't help but notice that a couple of people had just the opposite opinion of this book. All I can think is that they didn't read it carefully, or that they expected Al Parker to be what he seemed to be on film. From all I gathered from the book, Drew Okun was a great guy. I wish I could have known him.Read the book and you'll have a better sense of the gay porn industry from its early years through the AIDS crisis. Kudos to Roger Edmonson for giving substance to a legendary figure in underground gay culture."
B0007J1QW0,Doctor Mirabilis: A novel,,AUEY946M1L939,"John L Murphy ""Fionnch""",7/7,5.0,1278806400,Roger Bacon comes alive,"Along with Helen Waddell's ""Peter Abelard,"" this novel recreates the struggle for individual conscience against clerical conformity marvelously and movingly. It is not easy; more difficult than Waddell if as ambitious as the previous reviewer's nod to ""The Name of the Rose"" by Umberto Eco in its intellectual range and intricate themes. As a ""trained medievalist"" myself I found Blish's research impressively integrated into his evocation of the times when Roger Bacon fought the political and ecclesiastical powers to advance experimental science, and the need for the forces of reason to assert themselves, however hesitantly due to the lack of scientific progress, during the thirteenth century.As Blish tells in his preface, he captures the syntax and flavor of Middle English in passages where characters would have reverted to it rather than the French of court and diplomat, or the Latin of friars and scholars. The earlier chapters can take, therefore, a while to sink in as you adjust your mind to a different dialect, a different mode of expression. But this then allows you deeper immersion into the mentalities of the characters, often taken from real life chronicles, in an era where friars and inquisitors, kings and barons, heirs and bishops, all contended for the prizes that Church and State contended to control.Blish expands the little we may know of Bacon's personal story and mixes in the ideas of his era. He captures what Paris and Oxford must have felt like as the universities grew larger and less tolerant. This makes a nice companion with Waddell for the scene since Abelard, and with Eco for the twist on the controversies that while shelved under philosophy or theology now back then drew partisans and protesters to take sides as vehemently as would Marxists or neo-cons in our own time.Roger outwits his temporal masters, and he learns how to practice disguise. He inquires into alchemy and takes on Thomistic doctrines in the name of greater fidelity to innovation, even as he must rein in his own tendencies under an Order and Papacy who fear schism and heresy, as well it seems as any independence of thought. You find yourself eager to see who wins the Parisian disputation of Roger with Albertus Magnus, you watch as the chained mastiff at a decaying castle snarls as Roger talks with a forlorn noblewoman, you witness the interrogation of radicals by those in charge. You enter the prison cell where dissident friars seeking the apocalyptic reforms and Holy Poverty are jailed, and you are there, somehow, at this dogged English Franciscan's last moments.For all its challenges, this book proved a valuable testimony to Blish's ability to make us care about the plight of an inquirer whose name now, if barely recalled, is shrouded in magic and hearsay. Blish separates what may well have happened, and he brings us as close to the what-if reality as we can come. Highly recommended for the undaunted reader willing to rise up to a level demanding attention and rewarding concentration."

Bird ""Ramseelbird""",10/12,5.0,1084492800,So he sailed away for a year and a day,"I haven't a clue how one goes about reviewing the book that is perhaps the most beloved, respected, and widely enjoyed American picture book of the last 100 years. Maurice Sendak could never have imagined that his canny ""Where the Wild Things Are"" would not only capture the Caldecott Award of 1963, but go on to be hailed by critics, loved by librarians, and considered by parents to be one of the finest works of picture book art ever concocted. Is the book deserving of its praise? I suppose. But honestly, it is very difficult to read it today without getting caught up in its publicity and hype. On the whole, though, it is an enjoyable read and few can resist its charms.We begin the book with two small vignettes of the naughty things Max does that get him sent to bed. Max is a boy outfitted in a wolf suit, and after being sent to his room he finds his boudoire changed completely into a wild forest. After hopping a nearby boat and traveling, ""In and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are"" he is in a land of monsters. Taming them by staring them down, the Wild Things make Max their king and celebrate his crowning. Max proclaims that a wild rumpus should start, and start it does. When it ends, however, Max decides that he needs to be near someone who loves him. He leaves his beloved Wild Things, sails back into his room, and goes down to dinner where, on a single white page, we are told, ""it was still hot"".Simultaneously combining the wish to be a wild naughty creature uninhibited by love, or rules, or society and at the same time revealing the human need for comfort, the book is a success. In its illustrations, those wild crazy creatures with their too large eyes and sharp razor-like claws, it is a success. In its text, the elegantly presented last line or the repetition of wild things saying ""I'll eat you up"", it is a success. Heck, the book is good. And really, what more is there to say? Reviewing classics like this one is a pointless job. I'm not going to be shocking and say that every reviewer since the 1960s is wrong about this book, cause they're not. They're right, it's great. Does it deserve the huge publicity and love its garnered? Maybe. Maybe not. But the adults like it and the kids like it, and that is (as they say) enough. So take it home and love it yourself. It is a great book."
B000OW4E7O,Separate Peace,,A3V8QZI6FM3SZ9,A. Abruzzese,5/7,3.0,1109030400,"More ""vague"" than ""dark""","What motivates these characters? What do they want? Do they succeed or do they fail? Why or why not? Sometimes ambiguity is a useful literary device, but here, I felt that the characters, their relationship, and the central conflict of the story were more confused than they were deliberately ambiguous.The plot revolves around an incident between the two central characters, ostensibly friends, in which one may or may not have acted with malice aforethought toward the other. At the first, I didn't feel that the incident itself was especially shocking or egregious. One has this sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop, as the characters grope their way through the aftermath of the incident in a manner that doesn't seem to me to advance their respective understandings of themselves, each other, or their surroundings to any significant degree. They seem static and without clear motivation. Then the other shoe does drop, in a sense, at the very end of the book. The other shoe is more significant in it's import than the initial incident, but it's an act of god and it comes and goes so quickly that that too, leaves the reader confused as to it's impact on the other characters. It feels like it's just there as a way of magnifying significance (or maybe, just ending the book), and not for any other reason.I don't think the central question of this book is, ""Did he or didn't he?"" I think it's fairly clear that we are to understand that he acted somewhat deliberately, but not with complete premeditation, nor totally out of hate, and without complete understanding of his own actions, and that's the limit of what there is to know about that. It's not a question with an answer; he doesn't even know himself- that's deliberate ambiguity, and that's fine. I think the central question would be more like ""What is the nature of the relationship between these two characters that generates these feelings?"" or ""Why do we sometimes do malicious things when we don't mean to be malicious people?"" But I don't think it's clear by any means, and I don't think the book suggests a lot of answers."

B000OWYJQ0,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,,A3A6GXILVT9JNW,Jeanne Tassotto,3/3,5.0,1074988800,This is why Agatha Christie is the 'Queen of Crime',"Hercule Poirot has lost interest in the dective business since the departure of Hastings to South America. He has retired to a small village to grow vegetable marrows and live a quiet life. He discovers that vegetable marrows do not grow in an orderly manner and that crime does not limit itself to the city.The village is buzzing with gossip about the suicide of a local well to do widow and then is sent reeling by the murder of Roger Ackroyd, the wealthiest man in town. Poirot is drawn into these problems by Ackroyd's niece, Flora and finds himself not only dealing with murder but also with blackmail, petty theft and romance.In Hastings absence the story is told by the local doctor who is also a next door neighbor of Hercule Poirot.When this novel came out in 1926 it was immensely popular and somewhat controversial in that it broke one of the 'rules' for a good dectective novel (and you will have to read the book to find out which one). THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD ranks with AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (AKA TEN LITTLE INDIANS) and MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS as Christie at her most orginal.This story is also significant in that one of the characters, Caroline, the doctor's sister, has been credited by Christie as being the forerunner of Miss Marple. The soon to be familiar Christie theme of small towns as hot beds of intrigues both large and small is seen here for the first time.This book has aged very gracefully, the first time reader of today will probably be just as surprised as the readers of the 1920's were. As always with a Christie the clues are all there fairly laid out for the reader to follow."

To put it simply, it changed my life. William Least Heat Moon's outlook on life, his curiousity about everyday folk, it just blew me away. When my father and I went to visit colleges, we'd stop at restaurants and see how many wall calendars they had. The book showed how life isn't about rushing the whole time, making a ton of money, success in life is not dictated by these things. On the contrary, appreciate what's right in front of you. I'm a sophomore in college now, I still don't have the answers to the world, nobody really does, but I thank Blue Highways for instilling in me a curiousity and drive to enjoy the finer, simpler things in life."

And they were primarily young and healthy. In the early 20th Century, people who survived the diseases of childhood were relatively robust. Yet they were the primary victims of this plague. So many young parents died in Boston that the Italian Home for Children was created to handle the orphans of Italian immigrant families who had settled there. Interestingly, the first signs of the epidemic were in Boston and nearby Fort Devens, where returning troops may have brought the disease.This was a world epidemic that spread even from Patagonia to the Arctic. We often read about the Black Plague of the Middle Ages, where almost a third of the populatiion in parts of Europe perished. But we hear very little on the Influenza Epidemic (only that it killed more people than WWI) and not much more.The most fascinating part of the book deals with an astonishing effort to try to resurrect the genes of the 1918 flu from preserved lung tissue of a flu victim that had been stored in a vast government warehouse. The scientists were attempting to piece together the relationship of the 1918 virus (this must be the finest example of a viral archeological sample) to the 1997 Hong Kong Flu. The HK 1997 flu shared some scary similarities to the 1918 flu symptoms--young, healthy people were dying, their lungs suddenly filling up with pneumonia-like fluids. This leads to the question if the 1918 epidemic could happen again?Gina Bari Kolata is an esteemed science reported for the New York Times and has been almost obsessed by the mystery of this epidemic. She is well qualified to write such a medical/scientific mystery."

But this book lags behind 1984 in the literary sense.Make no mistake. Huxley was a genius. He was far ahead of his time and had many ideas about the future that have become real. But the problem with the book is his writing.Orwell is such a fantastic writer that, while you shudder at the bleak vision he has for the world, you become more interested in the characters of the book. Huxley's characters are just props. Huxley felt like sharing his ideas, but he couldn't just write about them. It seems like he just inserted the characters in so that there would actually be some in the book. Without good characters, a book seriously lags. If Huxley had just been a better writer, the book would be worthy of the comparisons to 1984 that it always recieves."

The descriptions of the battles between Zeus and the Titans made for vivid and stirring oration in the hands of a great speaker, as he boasts that he was by citing his awards. However, I was more intrigued by Works and Days. The advice of Hesiod was, indeed, sagacious: ""It is good to take from what is available, but sorrow to the heart to be wanting what is not."" And I liked this one: ""Right gets the upper hand over violence in the end."" At times he seemed like Thoreau incarnate preaching industry and self-reliance from his little cabin on Walden Pond: ""Avoid shady seats and sleeping til sunrise at harvest time, when the sun parches the skin. At that time get on with it and gather home the harvest, rising before dawn so that your livelihood may be assured. For the morning accounts for a third of the work."" Or this one: ""For property is as life to wretched mortals."" Some of his advice is quaint, as when a man should take a wife. The thing of it is that so much of what passed for wisdom in ancient days would still pass for it today."

At the same time, though not suprising, Hollywood missed most of the novel's story. The political theories voiced in the novel mostly by Mr. Dubois (Lt-Col., rt) are not that far fetched because as the book suggests, what is the use of a military if one does not plan to use it. The strength of the book is the fact that it is story of growth. Johnnie Rico, the novel's &quot;first person&quot; protagonist, beginning as a rich kid and finding he lacked purpose/direction in life and ending up a career Lt. in the Mobile Infantry. Hollywood though made a mess of the novel's ideas because of course the action was more important and there always had to be a love triangle. Carmen was mentioned only a few times and and Dizzy Flores had a sex change somewhere along the line and was only mention twice, both in reference to his death. In the book the soldiers were men and the Naval pilots were women. The movie was just a little more politcaly correct by having co-ed units.

This would certainly be a good description of the effect A Deepness in the Sky had on me. I was drawn in and held captive by the most effective type of magic there is - good storytelling.Vinge draws interesting characters, which though often larger than life, always have something human at their core. This is especially true of the alien characters in the novel which we come to know almost better than their human counterparts.And these characters inhabit a landscape of curious and provocative ideas. What could it truly be like to travel the stars in a sublight starship? What might a civilization be like whose sun dies every 50 years? What is the difference between fascination and obsession? Between the desire to communicate and the desire to control?I don't intend to give away any of the plot for those who haven't read it, and I'm sure there are many reviews here which adequately give readers the gist, but to me the one of the most delightful facets of this book comes toward the end. Vinge has deftly turned on its head the entire subgenre of alien invasion and made invasion of an alien world by humans as scary as anything in HG Wells.That and many other little touches make this a fascinating and delightful read."

As he looks back with affection & describes his childhood in a strict, hardworking, but loving family on a farm in back country Depression-Era Georgia, Mr Carter comes across as a genuinely kind and good man who respects his fellow-men & women - regardless of color or creed; who is tolerant of - though not entirely blind to -- the shortcomings & foibles of others, and truly incapable of seeing evil in anyone. In short, he is the Ideal Christian. This also goes a long way to explain why subsequently he became so widely respected on the International stage in his second career as Humanitarian & Fixer of the World's Problems.Mr Carter paints a colourful word-picture of his boyhood home, the close-knit community, the Carter farm, the livestock, the hunting dogs, his family, and his neighbours, the black tenant farmers and their children with whom he worked and played. There is nostalgia for a time and way of life that largely disappeared from this continent half a century ago, when children worked harder & shouldered more responsibility than today's young people can even imagine, but which was the making of them as responsible adults. Yet his writing style is innocent & light-hearted, and occasionally down-right laughable as, for example, when he gives us some examples of his rural childhood diction. It is hard to imagine the urbane, educated Mr Carter uttering the words ""We et a bait of plums"" or, having travelled 30 miles to see the flooding Flint River, ""Wheh de ribber, Daddy? Is it down in dat creek?""This book touched me on a more personal level as well. I was not far into it before I realised it reminded me so much of the spell-binding stories my mother used to tell us children around the dinner table, stories of her life growing up on a 240 acre Clay Belt farm as one of 15 children of Ukrainian immigrants. The climate, the geography and the neighbours' ethnicity may have been worlds away from the Carters, but her life and her experiences could just as well have happened down the dusty road from Plains, Georgia.Attention Jimmy Carter: If you read this - I asked my mother about the sound made by the metal clicker on the handle of the milk separator. She is an expert: one of her chores was to operate the milk separator; and afterward to disassemble, clean & reassemble all its the component parts, which she could perform as rapidly as a soldier does with his rifle.Mother says you have to turn the handle faster & faster until it reaches the speed necessary for the cream to separate from the milk inside the machine. The change in the tone of the ""clicker"" is determined by the speed of the turning handle & occurs when the required speed has been reached for the separation to occur.Mr Carter is one of only a handful of public figures with whom I would care to be acquainted.

In my opinion, Robert Alexander is the American version of Alexander Solzhenitsyn.The reader can not help but also become a captive along with the Tsar and his family. The writing is so descriptive, that the reader can almost actually see and smell the events as they take place. What history, what tragedy, what sadness, what waste, yet... what superb writing!

Dickey uses great details in the beginning of the book to describe the characters to you. He gives you a wonderful background for the rest of the story. The vivid imagery he uses adds to the book continuously. The overall plot is just amazing. The only part i didnt like was the amount of details. At some points the details kept you reading at other points you just wanted to get on with the story. The way he uses things in nature to represent things happening in the characters lives is also great. His wide range of types of characters makes the book all the more interesting. You jump from an illiterate mountain man, to a guitar playing nice guy, to a guy who wants to be immortal and loves nature. If you know a little about the author it also helps in reading the book.

0786932287,"The Lone Drow: The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book II",7.99,A2ZP92MJQZDQTN,A. Chu,10/11,1.0,1152662400,A very disappointing read...,"I have read many of Salvatore's books over the years and I must say that this book is the worst that I have read. As many reviewers have mentioned, there is very little plot or character development. Many of the battle sequences seem overly ridiculous (Gutbuster brigade charges orc defensive post, easily overwhelming while taking few, if any, losses) or repetitive (reading about orcs assaulting dwarf lines loses its appeal after 15 times). Surprising, since the plot is virtually nonexistent, there seems to be so many plot holes that you, as Schwarzenegger would say, ""could drive a hummer through it"".Anothering disappointing feature is Drizz't. Even though he's a drow master swordsman, he acts like an distraught emo-kid during this book. Reading his internal dialogue which consists of ""I'm hurt. Get angry, turn on Hunter mode..."" gets boring fast. The rest of his crew have subjugated their roles to being ""invulnerable"" soldiers killing dozens (perhaps hundreds) of orcs while merely taking the occasional glancing blow.Also, almost all of the supporting characters are exceptionally annoying, especially Pikel and Nanfoodle. Even more annoying are some of the character names. If Nanfoodle doesn't sound ridiculous enough, Cordio Muffinhead is definitely testing the limits of naming convention.I highly discourage anyone from reading this very poorly written series. Newcomers to Salvatore's work should start with the excellent Dark Elf trilogy to see Drizz't in all his glory without the baggage that is Cattibrie, Regis, and Bruenor (I never much liked his one-dimensional companions much, probably due to the fact that they are so one-dimensional; except for when Wulfgar was going through his psychological trauma but even then, he still wasn't very interesting)."

B000GS4N7W,THE MALTESE FALCON - A Sam Spade Mystery,,A3E8QNDC7CV44,Paul Weiss,1/1,4.0,1293580800,The genesis of hard-boiled detective fiction,"Private eye, Sam Spade, and his erstwhile partner, Miles Archer, are having a slow day. Spade rolls a cigarette from his stock of Bull Durham. When a beautiful young dish introduces herself with an alias and tells them a story of her younger, impressionable sister having run off with a man named Floyd Thursby, the money is a powerful incentive to accept the case. Despite their new client's wholesome good looks and appearance of youthful innocence, Spade and his secretary, Effie Perrine, have a feeling that this woman is going to be nothing but trouble. When Archer is murdered tailing their mark and Thursby himself is later found murdered, Spade and his client naturally fall under suspicion. As Spade begins to investigate the murders and his client, whose real name is discovered to be Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the case mutates into a sinister international chase after a priceless historical figurine, the Maltese Falcon, originally intended as a gift from Malta to the King of Spain hundreds of years ago but lost in transit when a ship sank in a storm.If you'd like to discover the source for virtually every convention, stereotype and clich&eacute; used for the hard-boiled detective genre, then THE MALTESE FALCON is your book. Dashiel Hammett started it all and Sam Spade is the progenitor for virtually every lone gun-toting, cigarette smoking, hard-bitten gumshoe that followed to the present day - cynical, quick with easygoing sardonic wit and clever banter, lots and lots of casual sex (of course), ambiguous morality, bitter, chauvinistic, single-minded with a strong but entirely self-defined professional ethic, tough, manipulative and self-centered but intensely loyal to those he chooses, and, of course, gritty and rough-cut handsome!The tough guy, short and snappy dialogue is immensely entertaining and, while it is now quite clich&eacute;d (but admittedly still entertaining), it must have seemed extraordinary, novel and intensely innovative when THE MALTESE FALCON was first published in 1930. Brigid O'Shaughnessy serves as the requisite femme fatale that has also been copied and repeated countless times from Philip Marlowe to Mike Hammer to James Bond.Considered to be one of the 100 best English language novels of the 20th century, THE MALTESE FALCON certainly deserves some space on your library shelves. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"
B000HKKVZW,The Dark Tower VII,,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,Jon Thompson,17/26,5.0,1096070400,What holds the cup up?,"In one of the Douglas Adams' ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" novels (I forget which one), Arthur Dent (the protagonist) comes across a massive (miles high) statue of himself commemorating a little, almost forgotten incident in one of the earlier books where he throws a cup of tea, which in some odd way changed forever the lives of the inhabitants of the world he happens to find himself on. In honor of that moment, they built this huge statue of him and the cup, already having left his fingers, seemingly floating in the air at the end of his gigantic statue fingers. He encounters one of the inhabitants of that world and asks ""What holds the cup up?"" The answer... ""art.""The last volume of the Dark Tower saga is kind of like that. What makes it work? Art.But ""art"" is a delicate thing, living or dying in the eye of the beholder.If you like Stephen King or the universe of the Dark Tower, then you will believe in the art and the cup will remain suspended in mid-air, firmly locked in place. If you don't believe, the cup will fall with a resounding crash, perhaps obliterating your previously held image of Mr. King and all his works. It will be an individual choice.A couple of notes, however:If you haven't followed the Dark Tower saga from the very beginning, your response to this seventh volume is likely to be nothing more than ""What the....???""If you haven't read the rest of the Stephen King opus (especially Everything's Eventual, Hearts in Atlantis, The Stand, Salem's Lot, Heartbreak House, The Talisman, Insomnia and perhaps a dozen others) then you will miss the ""click"" when certain characters put in an appearance here.If you look upon an author writing himself into one of his stories as some kind of ego-fest, then you will snatch away a very necessary element that makes the Dark Tower stand.In short, the Dark Tower is written in a language called ""Stephen King"", and in order to understand it you must study that language and prepare for it. Consider it to be an alien tongue, like French, and look upon the Dark Tower as Les Miserables in a first edition, printed in Paris. If you really want the opportunity to ""get it"" as it was intended by the author, you have to know French. Do do that, you gotta pay attention in class first.If, however, you happen to know that language, then by all means, settle back, read, and decide for yourself whether you are reading ""art"" or whether it's time to look up and watch out for falling cups.For me, the cup stands rooted in the sky, unmoving and beautiful. Bravo, Stephen King."

The entire first page of the 3rd chapter, where I have stopped out of sheer annoyance, is center-justified.I am all for publishers making books more accessible (and making more money) by converting paper books to Kindle format.

0631234543,Introduction to Old English,,A1G072NCSANUXP,david johnston,6/13,5.0,1296432000,"Old English: more than a language, a life-changing experience","When I came across this little treasure two years ago, I had no idea how phenomenal an investment this book would prove to be. While reading this review, keep in mind that the full benefits of this book can only be fully understood by the beholder of such a brilliant work as this. The review I shall proceed to write is by no means an indicator of the worth or helpfulness of this book. An analysis of such would provide the potential buyer with little more than a incentive to purchase the book. As an owner and a frequent student of Dr. Baker's definitive guide to Old English, I feel compelled to provide the reader of this review with not merely a reason for purchase of this absolute must-have for any fan or admirer of Old English. Rather, I wish to use this review as a means of inspiring you to discover your unbeknown passion for Old English, and the fruitful benefits associated with fluency in this romantic and historically rich tongue. Words cannot describe the delight I have partaken whilst developing my comprehension and analytical skills associated with the Old English Language. Soon you too will be shouting ""Hr&eacute;sigor!"" every time you open this book and the magic of Old English is unleashed unto the mind.Rewind two years. Taking a fall from the recession back in 2008, I lost my job and all financial stability. My wife divorced me and left with my kids shortly after. Six weeks passed me by as I scoured the job market, but to no avail. Shortly after I had taken to the streets as an umbrella vendor, I had received a postcard from my wife with a picture on the front of her with my smiling children and her new lover Alfonso, a youthful Puerto Rican man who made a comfortable living selling yachts in the Caribbean. On the back of the postcard, my wife had scribbled a quick note, which for the sake of this review, I shall not pass along to the reader. Life was looking grim, and though I tried to keep my spirits high, I couldn't help but feel the immense weight of hopelessness on my shoulders.And then it happened. A local bookstore which I frequented was holding a book signing. Some author of a book regarding a passionate vampire had attracted a crowd of thousands inside the doors. There was something about the social gathering which made me long to hold a place in that immense crowd, to be part of something for the first time in a long time. As I made my way through the doors, something caught my eye. The emerald cr&iacute;stesml as I never had seen it before was so beautifully illustrated on the cover of a book. My eyes could not shield themselves from the awesomeness which had just befallen them. Yes, I had found it. ""Introduction to Old English"" by Peter S. Baker.Needless to say, I went back to my shack and read this book nonstop. I couldn't get enough. The beauty of the language took me so unexpectedly. It was as if I had just met myself for the first time. Later that night I went to a bar. I received estranged looks from the bartender as I refused to request my beverages in any language other than Old English and insisted (in Old English, of course) that my drink be served in a giant iron tankard encrusted with baby bronze eagles. As I settled for a Miller Light, a young girl approached me. I thought my eyes had deceived me, but no, the fact of her radiant beauty was realized as she spoke those soft words to me: ""&aacute;byge mec sum b&eacute;or?"" (will you buy me a mead brew?) I smiled and replied ""Bt fger!"" She had made my sullen heart leap with joy. I had fallen in love, and this beautiful woman replaced my loneliness with the utmost happiness known to man. A beautiful girl who loves me just as much as I love her and Old English combined, what more can a man ask for? Three months later I became the CEO of a major financial corporation and now make millions of dollars every second. Without this book, I have no idea how this dream which is my reality could have come true.So when considering the purchase of this book, do not merely weigh the pros and cons of the selections of 7th century prose or totality of grammatical depth of this work compared to others. Consider the stories you will tell your children as you pass this book along to them, and the timeless memories of recounting the rich works of Beowulf and Anglo folklore in the greatest tongue ever spoken by man--Old English. Be one of the 800 people on this earth who actually know this language. Learn it, live it, love it. Old English will change your life. Thank you, Dr. Baker, and thank you, Old English. Andetnes."
B000J0JPY8,The Odessa File,,,,9/10,5.0,928108800,This book puts the Nazi's right in your home !!,"The Odessa FileFrom the moment the diary of a broken and desolate concentration camp survivor lands up in the hands of reporter Peter Miller, the reader is pulled along into a world of crazed Nazi revanchists, wily and vengeful Mossad infiltrators, obstructionist German bureaucrats, and a pathetic, browbeaten printer who's just a little too clever for his own good. Miller is warned off, shoved around, ambushed, and almost blown up, but he manages eventually (with a little help from Simon Wiesenthal) to find his way into the heart of the shadowy organization known as the ODESSA.THE ODESSA FILE plays off in Germany during the 60's and examines the persistent rumors and tempting evidence that points to the existence of a secretive organization that masterminded the escape of Nazi war criminals and perpetuated Nazi ideals the world over. The story revolves around a cache of documents known as The Odessa File that protected the identities of former members of Hitler's dreaded SS since shortly before the end of World War II. The book is of course a piece of fiction, but many of the characters aren't fictitious at all. SS Captain Eduard Roschmann, for instance, really was the Butcher of Riga, and he really did sneak past the mob of tribunals and other judiciary apparatuses that sprung up after the war (at least as far as anyone knows). Peter Miller, is the reporter who hunts him down, we may assume him to be completely fictious, but as for everyone in between - who knows?Therein lies much of the novel's suspense. What really happened to the German-designed rockets that Nasser was supposed to have ready in time for the Six Day War? How did the SS acquire new identities for its members so quickly after the war's end and where did it get the money needed to do so? Could the head of the company that made your coffee machine be a former officer of the SS and a wanted war criminal? Frederick Forsyth has truly mastered the art of intertwining reality with fiction and vice versa and his ability to do so is what gives this book it's thrilling atmosphere.THE ODESSA FILE is the novel that established Forsyth as the heavyweight champion of his genre, political espionage. The story's characters are vividly imagined (if they are imagined at all), and in the 27 years since its first publication, they've lost none of their energy. The book is compact, credible, as politically sophisticated as his first novel, The Day of the Jackal, skillfully researched and much more neatly written. Assuming peace doesn't unexpectedly arrive in the Middle East, The Odessa File will still be delivering knockout punches long after the average thriller has called off the fight."
B000P44H50,Comstock Lode (The Louis L'Amour Collection),,A3T0LQU40KRLZP,R. Bellamy,0/0,5.0,1340928000,This book started me down the L'Amour trail.,"There are enough reviews here about ""Comstock Lode"" that you might think you know the story well enough to skip the book. But, if you like westerns at all, or even think you might, this book will turn you into a L'Amour fan.I picked it up after seeing it on a rack not too long after we had returned from a trip to Reno. While we were there, we visited Virginia City and discovered, much to our joy, that it looks and feels very nearly as it must have in the latter 1800's. It's located away from Reno and Carson City, up on a mountainside that looks out over miles of desert. It still has the old Victorian buildings and boardwalk main drag. There is virtually no structure that will remind you that it's not 1875 or so. The only difference between it and a Hollywood version is that it now sports a paved road through town. Move off the main drag just one street and you're likely to find yourself on an old mining claim or near a real working mining operation. So, if you decide to read the book, you might want to Google Earth Virginia City to get a sense of what it was like in context of the book.So, ""Comstock Lode"" was a particularly interesting story to read since I had such a complete mental picture of Virginia City going in. I could still taste the dust, feel the wind and remember what it felt like to sit in one of the the saloons. What really made it interesting though, were the stories about the history of Virginia City, it's businesses and characters that L'Amour no doubt modeled, at least in part, on real places, events and people that occurred and existed around that time in history.To date, I have read more than 28 L'Amour books since ""Comstock Lode"" and have four new ones already on hand. Every one has been total entertainment and I plan to reread ""Comstock Lode"" when my daughter and her family finishes it. I loved Larry McMurtry's ""Lonesome Dove"" and recently read one of Wm. W. Johnstone's books, ""Screaming Eagles"", but L'Amour is the master, IMO, and this has to be one of his best."

0140860282,Wuthering Heights (Penguin Audiobooks),,ATKL8C5IQ56E9,informednow,6/7,3.0,1181260800,Do you call this love?,"This classic has a reputation as being a grand ""love"" story. It is more about dark obession than ""love"". The characters are all psychologically damaged people (nuts) who seem to thrive on making each other miserable. I cannot figure out what Catherine had that made two men fall madly in love with her--she is spoiled, selfish, and extremely stupid. Edgar is a spineless wimp who certainly knew he had a rival--but refused to deal with it. Heathcliff is a sadist who is obessed with (not in love with) Catherine; he is willing to harm even himself to cause suffering to other people. Who could love a man that nasty? Isabella is another silly woman who could not see what was going on around her and falls in ""love"" with her imagined version of Heathcliff. And on and on...Nelly Dean is the only sane person in this novel, and she was crazy to stay around these looney families as long as she did.The atmosphere saves the book from complete ruin--it is as dark ,moody, and brooding as the characters. Even the houses seem to snarl and brood and take on the personalities of characters. One is compelled to continue in the book just to see how much more crazy things will get with every body being so dysfunctional and obssessed with having their way. The writing is poetic, and the final scene between Catherine and Heathcliff could be touching--if you can forget how absurd it is.Maybe I am too much of a realist to get carried away with this type of novel. I would not touch Heathcliff with a ten foot pole and can't imagine what women see in the character, other than dark good looks. I cannot imagine what a man would see in Catherine. Or how any of these crazy characters' actions spell l-o-v-e."

This is not a history book and it is not a work of scholarship. This is a propaganda piece just like the stuff the Soviet Union tirelessly cranked out during its heyday. The author's premise is that the US is the world's chief bad guy and is the root cause of every major conflict in the world. To support this premise the author fills his book with distortions and half-truths; casually disregarding important facts and details.There are endless examples of the dishonest approach this book takes and some of these have been listed by other reviewers. Instead, I will give an analogy of the author's typical approach to history. Let's say I want to convince a person who knows nothing about Joseph Stalin, that this man was a great leader and freedom fighter. I would present it this way: as a young man Stalin joined the Bolsheviks, a group that advocated for the rights of workers and common people against the oppressive rule of the Russian Tsar. Eventually this group took control of the government. Fear and uncertainty resulted when the Bolshevik leader died. Stalin became leader. His economic policies led to unprecedented growth and industrialization. When Germany tried to invade Russia a second time, the country was ready and able to defend itself. They defeated the fascist Germans, and became a world superpower.Technically, everything I said was true. But I presented the story in a way that completely ignores the majority of historical fact. This is the method the author employs throughout Addicted to War. It is a dishonest distortion of history.There are two kinds of people that will enjoy Addicted to War: ideologues and fools."

I enjoy reading both inside school in my independent reading class or in my free time at home. While searching for a new book I ran into The Man In The Woods by Rosemary Wells.It is a well written story about a girl named Helen, who moves to a new town. If you have ever moved before, you can relate to this character and her need to fit in with the kids at her new school. Her first day doesn't go well until she meets Mr.Bro, her history teacher. That's how she joins the school paper and starts her quest for the perfect story and the quest to belong.Although she is very excited to write the perfect story for the school paper she runs into a problem. The one problem she runs into while writing her story will turn the town's history upside down. While testing her limits and her ability to believe in herself. Not only that, but a secret that has been kept for over one hundred years will finally be revealed.This book is a definite page turner from start to finish. I highly recommend this book to teenagers who love mystery and suspense. It keeps you guessing until the very end. It's a book you just can't put down!"

074347712X,Hamlet ( Folger Library Shakespeare),5.99,A1ZNGCNKCHW11,"Norman Strojny ""retired tech-person""",0/3,4.0,1228348800,A truly BLOODY play,"""Hamlet"" is considered, by some, to be Shakespeare's best work. I am not of that school of thought. I've read it. I've watched it played on a stage. I've watched a movie or two based on it. It could be better.Hamlet (the character) has problems. Apparently, his step-father killed his father. This obsesses Hamlet, who,also, is depressed, manic, neurotic, and fearful. Still, count up the dead bodies that accumulate during the play!One of the problems with the play is the ""play-within-a-play"" that goes on for too long. The complete Hamlet can play for over four hours, which is not good for business. Fantastic directors usually manage to get it done in under three hours. Usually, 10% or more of the lines get chopped. The play still drags. Also, usually, someone much too old plays Hamlet. Hamlet should be played by a 16 to 18 year old. So, it is easy to go wrong with this play.Nevertheless, this play fascinates us, all. Do not be satisfied with only one version of this play."

B000O36TP8,Thunderball,,A1NT7ED5TATUAM,Bill Slocum,0/1,4.0,1239408000,Enter Blofeld,"""Thunderball"" was Ian Fleming's ninth published James Bond book, his first Bond novel published in the 1960s (1961), and the first to feature a threat residing not in Soviet Russia, but from a shadowy international conspiracy, known as SPECTRE and run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld.""...he was one of those men - one meets perhaps only two or three in a lifetime - who seem almost to suck the eyes out of your head,"" Fleming writes of the enigmatic criminal mastermind, who goes here also by the alias ""Number Two"".""Number One"", for the moment, is Emilio Largo, one of Blofeld's underlings. Largo is Blofeld's selected leader for a plot which involves stealing two atomic bombs from a hijacked bomber and holding the world at ransom for 100 million British pounds in gold. Bond is sent to the Bahamas on a hunch by his superior M. There, 007 discovers Largo's operation and grows suspicious.""Thunderball"" makes good use of one of the best plots in the series, one Fleming worked on in script form with Jack Whittingham and Kevin McClory. The novel itself bears the unmistakable stamp of Fleming, weaving his usual descriptive magic with sunny tourist-trap landscapes and wondrous, deadly undersea scuba expeditions at night.You also got to love the left-field opening. Bond is sent by M to get himself purged of what M considers a too-deadly lifestyle. Not the kill-or-be-killed missions M sends him on, but Bond's smoking, drinking, and consumption of rich foods. Off Bond goes to a health farm, Shrublands, where he ironically comes up against SPECTRE for the first time in the form of a wolfish minor player named Count Lippe. For a while, Bond even accepts the regimen, counseling his housekeeper May on the pitfalls of denatured or ""dead"" foods. Thankfully, Bond snaps out of his granola ecstasy after a final run-in with the Count.""It just occurred to me that life's too short,"" he tells May. ""Plenty of time to watch the calories when one goes to heaven.""The book Bond was always a different character from the more rogue-ish Bond of the movies. Prone to the blues, self-questioning (especially about whether Largo is worth his suspicions), and emotionally connected here with at least one of his lovers, Domino Vitali, Largo's kept woman who earns Bond's respect initially with her no-apologies lifestyle. Domino is one woman who takes her sex as opportunistically as any man, even Bond, but Bond senses she has a real heart worth protecting.The story moves along quickly, much of it underwater. Bond wards off barracudas and sharks, dodges venom-tipped spears and grenades, and chews on Domino's foot when she steps on some sea-egg spines. The seduction is one of the best in the canon, especially when it's not clear who's doing the seducing.""This is the first time I've eaten a woman,"" Bond says. ""They're rather good.""The novel does sag in the last act, like ""gobirds2"" notes in another review here. Fleming seemed to have trouble ending his Bond novels. To this point, only ""Casino Royale"" and ""From Russia With Love"" had endings that lived up to their build-up. ""Thunderball"", unlike them, plays it rather straight, yet winds up rushed and convoluted anyway.SPOILERS - Three problems with the story worth relating to those who have already read the book. One, why does Largo enlist the brother of his mistress to execute his deadly plan, risking the possibility someone might look for her as a result? Two, why does Bond trust her anyway after making this connection, which would seem to tie her in with Largo's plan? Three, why can't Bond have Largo's craft intercepted by the sizable Navy assets at his disposal, once Largo's plot is found to be underway, rather than attempt a more dangerous attack underwater? - END SPOILERSI know, I know. It's Bond. If you ask too many questions, you're missing the point. Fortunately, ""Thunderball"" is the kind of novel that keeps those questions from being asked until after you are done reading it."

0786715847,Tilt-a-Whirl,,A30TK6U7DNS82R,Kevin Killian,2/3,5.0,1137974400,And Around And Around We Go,"I'm always late to the party, but I want to give my two cents about TILT A WHIRL, which was one of the best thrillers I've read in ages. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't let the Pepto pink cover put me off, nor did its picture of a roller coaster get me down. I was hooked right away by the narrative voice of the enchanting deputy Danny Boyle, who works as everyman describing to us he breadths and lineaments of the impenetrable Officer Ceepak, truly a cop in a million. If ever there was a book made for the movies, it was this one, and I hope the author laughs all the way to the bank, he deserves it, for rarely have i been on such a wild ride. The metaphor of the ""tilt-a-whirl"" is a great one, and Grabenstein seems determined not to let us down, for every time you think you have the story in your eyesights, a violent twist in the plot will shoot you down and you have to start building up readers confidence all over again.For newcomers to the book, just rest assured that everything you learn in the first fifty pages will be set absolutely upside down by page 100, and this reversal happens over and over again. There's not one but two amazing twist endings.The only thing that smacked of Hollywood hokum was the remarkable and totally unbelievable scene where two of the chief villains spend twenty or so pages telling the good guys the entire plot, how they did it, right down to the smallest detail, whereas in real life they would have lawyered up right away. this always happens in the Bond movies, where one whole reel is spent with the villain bragging about his world domination plans, but in an otherwise realistic police thriller, there's no room for this kind of unreal scene.I can't make up my mind whether or not I think Danny and Ceepak should return. They were great in this one book, but I wonder if their strawfoot-tenderfoot act would get stale the second time around. Anyhow, this is the kind of novel that makes roller coasters redundant. Grabenstein has the kind of talent lesser writers would sell their right arms for."

185723569X,Path of Daggers (Wheel of Time 08),,A2D7B6N22UB0H3,"Ian M. Gordon ""Smegdog""",28/33,1.0,1156464000,The Wheel of Time keeps turning...and turning...and turning...,"This series has become a complete disaster.As the plot gets more and more complicated, it also gets more and more meaningless. Mr. Jordan is apparently set on dragging this series out for another ten books at least. New subplots are introduced with each book, and there are now so many characters that it is hard to keep their names straight. There has been little to no development on the overall plot since the fourth book. It seems to me that if Rand suddenly died, and the plot ended, it would take another three books to tell what happened to the rest of the characters! (in exhaustive detail, of course) I generally find myself cheering when a character dies because it means that there will be one less person to hear about in the next book.Improbable events happen regularly, in order to stretch the series as far as possible. For example, most of the Forsaken have been killed by the seventh book. (""Damn!,"" thinks Mr. Jordan, ""I had planned to keep them around until book 27"") Instead of bringing out the next logical bad guy, the Dark One, the Forsaken are now being brought back to life, so that Rand has to kill them all again! This is such a poor excuse for a plot event that I laughed when I first read it. Similar events include Egwene becoming the Amyrlin seat and Birgitte becoming Elayne's warder.The characters are vain, immature, and unlikeable. They are mostly involved in unlikely romances, usually with multiple people. The men mope about, feel sorry for themselves, and make unbelievably stupid decisions. The women are cattish, delight in tormenting the men, and are astonishingly ungrateful. I have yet to find a truly symapthetic character. Character relationships are just as bad. (Mr. Jordan is more obsessed with sex than Sigmund Freud was.) Disliking a person seems to be the only prerequisite for falling in love with them.Though this has been harped on in previous reviews, it is absolutely true: Mr. Jordan is completely obsessed with writing about insignificant little details. From exactly what each and every character is wearing to exactly what each and every character is thinking, in each and every scene of the book, Mr. Jordan lists everything that is unimportant to the story. Below is a description of a character blowing their nose (I have chosen Nynaeve), in the style of the Wheel of Time series. You can see the excess of unnecessary details used to describe any action.""Nynaeve excused herself from the conversation about why Rand hadn't seen Elayne. Gathering up the hem of her Domani dress in pale green silk, Lan's favorite color, she turned away from the women at the table, who were entusiastically chattering on about Rand's personal affairs. 'Ninnies,' thought Nynaeve, ""they should be doing something useful, not idling their time away here. If they were from Emond's Field when I was wisdom there, the women's circle would set them right'. She sniffed loudly is their direction, and gave her braid a violent tug. She put her hand into the pocket of her high-necked gown, and drew out a red linen handkerchief, with an attractive paisley border. She remebered that it had been a gift from Lan from when he had still been Moiraine's warder. Her cross expression softened as her thoughts turned to Lan. She absent-mindedly tugged down the neckline of her dress, exposing a wide expanse of pale bosom, and fiddled with a strand of pearls that she wore around her neck. Lan liked pearls, she remembered. She wondered what the other women at the table would say if she got a room at the inn to share with him. They would probably say she was behind as forward as that Mayener hussy, Berelain. She suddenly realized what she was thinking about. 'Light burn Lan for making me think about Berelain,' she said to herself, 'men can be so mule headed sometimes.' She resolved to box the ears of the next man she met, just for being born a man. Elayne, who was sitting down at the table next to her, asked Nynaeve if she liked the new light blue silk dress with the lace collar that she was wearing. 'Hmmph,' said Nynaeve, 'it probably cost as much as a small village. You should be more careful with money Elayne. We are not in your mother's paalce at Caemlyn.' She gave her braid another angry tug.""If you have read any of the other Wheel of Time books, my advice is: do not read any more. This series hasn't gone anywhere since the fourth book, nor does it shows signs of going anywhere in the future. Robert Jordan will almost certainly die before he is able to finish of this series."

My take then: ""It's time for GONE WITH THE WIND to move over, the Civil War has finally produced a great novel. This story of a perilous journey across North Carolina and an equally difficult journey of the heart rings far truer than other accounts of the era, and affirms ones faith in modern readers (many months a best seller) and the literary establishment (National Book Award). My enthusiasm for Frazier's first novel is doubtless reinforced by the setting, these mountains I have chosen as home, which he paints in telling detail. Frazier's war is not heroic but brutally pointless. The protagonists only wish to survive into a better time."""

I was afraid it would be a boring story about talking rabbits that lived out their lives in a warren (and 475 pages of it!). I was completely mistaken. Although, it was about rabbits, in no way were their lives unexciting. The story, in fact, was not boring at all. Richard Adams does an amazing job with this book. He takes an idea that is not particularly enthralling and creates an epic adventure story. The farther I got into the story. The more I wanted to read. It just kept getting better and better. I had to constantly remind myself that the characters were rabbits because they were flawlessly given human traits. Before reading this story, I could not understand why it was so praised. Now I see, however, that this book is truly a masterpiece. I recommend this classic to anyone who likes adventure stories."

And yes, I did find this in a used book store. This was John Wyndham's first novel, originally serialized in a magazine, written when he went by the name John Beynon.Published in 1935 but set in 1964, ""The Secret People"" takes us to a place intruders never leave. After Mark Sunnet's rocket plane crashes in the Sahara Desert, which is being turned into a ""New Sea"" by France and Italy in a monumental feat of engineering, he and his girlfriend Margaret find themselves prisoners of a people determined to keep their existence secret. Hence the title of this book.These short-statured people (who resemble white pygmies) dwell in an underground network of vast caves and are, on the face of it, mired in primitivism. The caves are lit by luminous globes of unknown power, suggesting that this civilization was once highly developed technologically but is now long past its time of glory. While Margaret and her cat become a focus of worship, Mark is thrown in with the other prisoners. These are people of various nationalities who were unfortunate enough to stray into the pygmie's domain over the years - destined to live out their lives subsisting on the fungus of giant mushrooms which grow in the caves. While many are slumped in apathy, some of the captives have preserved their sanity by working on an escape tunnel. The rising water levels have heightened the sense of urgency.Because Wyndham was a fan of H.G. Wells, it is reasonable to guess he had read ""In the Abyss"", a story with a similar theme. The characters are an ever-resourceful set, which, apart from Mark and Margaret, include a couple of can-do Americans to boost morale, an English academic speculating on the history of the pygmies, a slimy villain, a good-natured African giant, and, to represent the pygmies, a philosophical priest. Wyndham's style in the 1930s is different to his more acclaimed style of the 1950s, but it remains readable today, even if it is a little dated."

Marsch,2/2,4.0,1264636800,There's Nothing Like the Original,"I recently taught this book to a group of five high school boys, and it was an amazing experience. We were able to move beyond our stereotyped ideas of the Pilgrims to see an account of them from the perspective of their leader. We were struck with the through-and-through integrity of these people who were willing to suffer so many ways for the cause of their Lord. So many times they gave the other guy the advantage and did not press their rights, while we moderns were becoming frustrated at their passivity. But in the end we saw the aggregate worth of their ""long obedience in the same direction,"" as mocking sailors and the Indians and many others saw that they truly lived out the faith they claimed.The detailed account of anyone's life, personal or corporate, will have tedium and unnecessary (to our thinking) minutiae, and Bradford's account does have a lot of material I might have edited out.

I especially like her warning, which I paraphrase as, &quot;Don't seek career advice from people who don't have careers, or relationship advice from people who don't have relationships.&quot; It's not completely accurate: some people can &quot;teach&quot; better than they can &quot;do.&quot; But it's worth considering.And her warning that every year has a &quot;winter phase&quot; is right on.Like most readers, I'm absorbing Salmonsohn's words after reading dozens of self-help books, so none of these ideas are really new.

England is beset with rumor of the supernatural--vampires, werewolves, and demons. Darwin approaches everything with an open-minded skepticism. Together with his treasure-anxious sidekick, Colonel Jacob Pole, Darwin delves deep into the mysteries that confront 18th century England finding, among other things, the Loch Ness Monster, Bonnie Prince Charlie, and a forgotten race of humans.Author Charles Sheffield has created a charming set of stories of a past not too different from our own. Darwin contains the best of Sherlock Holmes as well as the gluttony of Nero Wolfe. I suspect that Sheffield meant his novel to be a reminder to us, in the 21st Century, to always remember to look to rational and scientific causes before we ascribe whatever we see to the supernatural or unexplainable. It is easy to see why Sheffield, a scientist, would choose Erasmus Darwin as his hero.THE AMAZING DR. DARWIN is both powerful and amusing. Darwin is fallible enough to be sympathetic, and Pole is sympathetic without being completely brainless."

In describing how Momsen performs the first deep sea rescue of a marooned submarine crew, Maas tells a first-class tale. He describes how Momsen became one of the Navy's best officers, often not by blindly saying &quot;yes,&quot; but more often by challenging conventional wisdom and practicing relentless innovation -- even when it was not welcome or understood. He risked his life many times. The rescue of the crew of Squalus off the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire, is enough of a story to merit a place for Momsen. But Maas proceeds to describe Momsen's entire naval career, which includes a hand in bringing about nuclear submarines and even a stint at solving the worst problem in the entire fleet -- namely, bringing order to the Navy's worldwide mail. Momsen has been dead for more than 30 years, but his life and work are a story about leadership, innovation, practical organization politics, and being personally effective. It's a great book, a real page-turner. The only drawback is an occasional spell of technical briefing which produced nothing more in me than a desire to skip a few pages and return to the spellbinding story of this man's life's work."

0808510258,Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (Barron's Book Notes),,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""",2/2,5.0,1180396800,The Nature of Integrity,"The daughter of a noted attorney, Harper Lee was born in 1926 in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama. Although she studied law, she became increasingly interested in writing, and in the 1950s she created a series of semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical writings about the events of her childhood. Over time, these writings developed into a novel, and she completed TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in 1959. Published in 1960, the book not only proved an instant bestseller but received every critical accolade available, including the Pulitzer Prize. It also proved controversial, and almost fifty years later the American Library Association continues to list it as one of the most frequently challenged and banned books in both the United States and abroad.Told in the form of an extended flashback, the novel unfolds in a series of scenes in which Lee seems intent upon evoking the small challenges and quiet charms of childhood in a small, Depression era southern town. We are introduced to Scout, our tomboy narrator, and her brother Jem and their playmate Dill, and we join in their summer games: climbing to the treehouse, rolling in a tire, and most particularly their fascination with ""Boo"" Radley, a mysterious recluse of unsavory past who has long been a focus of town gossip.Written with remarkable simplicity, it is a charming, often comical tale--but as the story extends it comes to focus not so much upon Scout and Jem as upon their father Atticus Finch, a noted local attorney who is suddenly appointed to defend a black man accused of the vicious rape of a white woman. And Atticus Finch is a man of rare integrity, quietly but firmly determined to bring the facts of the case to light. In doing so, he places himself and his children at storm center of a controversy that threatens to tear both his family and community apart and which ends in violence and death.In 1960, with the United States of America embroiled in the Civil Rights movement, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was considered a political statement. It proved a lightening rod for controversy, and in truth the novel still speaks to us of the evils of racism. If this were all, it would be a novel of historical interest and little more. But that is not the case.The two threads of the story--the children's fascination with Boo Radley and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson--are not separate portions; they interweave and ultimately dovetail into a seamless whole, remarkable in narrative, brilliant in clarity, to create a portrait of social bigotry counterbalanced by deep humanity, at times monstrous, at times deeply beautiful as only perfect honesty can be. The characters spring to vivid life; the events unfold with a mixture of the unexpected and inevitable. There is pain, there is suffering, but there is growth as well, and as the children grow in knowledge and understanding so too does the reader. It is a remarkable work, not only capturing the texture of life in a small southern town, but bringing its events to a universal level that transcends time and place and touches something that speaks to the best in all of us.Since the novel's publication, Harper Lee has become almost as much a recluse as Boo Radley, seldom appearing in public, even more rarely speaking or writing for publication. She has never again created a work of this length. Even so, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD places her at the forefront of American authors. This is a great novel. I wish I had written it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

B000N6OV4C,Tenth Circle,,A1II8I66S9E84Y,Maureen R. Tagliaferro,0/0,5.0,1356480000,A Thrilling Ride Through Hell,"Of all the Picoult books I read, I found this one to be the most depressing. This is not so much because of the heartbreak and alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl, as it is for a general loss of innocence among today's youth. I know about peer pressure and the heightened sexual awareness that comes with being this age; but party games, such as ""Stoneface"" and ""Rainbow"" were all too new for me. Yet, I have no doubt these are real games that stemmed from Picoult's research rather than her imagination - and that is the depressing part.As for the intriguing part, Picoult's novels are prone to the unexpected, and this one took more twists and turns than a cable car on the most crooked San Francisco streets. I would have been dizzy, but I was enjoying the ride way too much and was holding on tightly - to the pages, that is, which I was turning faster than Trixie Stone can take her next disastrous leap into hell.Warning Possible Spoiler Alerts. - The major problem I had with this book was that as much as Trixie's parents showered her with unconditional love, they failed to hold her accountable for her actions. In fact her father, who loves her more than life itself, admitted to knowing (or at least suspecting) that his young teen-aged daughter was sexually active; but he forced himself to dispel that notion. This fit in with the theme of self-deception, and unfortunately in real life even the best of parents can possess that trait.What I found unrealistic, however, was Trixie's impulsive escape to Alaska. Even when Daniel instinctively and miraculously found her, he didn't bother to ask his emotionally distraught and immature 14 year-old how she managed to get herself on a plane that traveled cross country. He just nonchalantly took it for granted he would find her there.Other flaws included the fact that most newspapers do not print anonymous letters to the editor, Moss Minton would have been suspended, if not expelled, for his prank, but instead went unpunished and remained on the hockey team, and Daniel and Laura should have forbidden Trixie to have further contact with her friend Zephyr who encouraged Trixie's behavior. However, even these discrepancies can't take away from the realistic portrayals of human complexities, the multiple layers of personality, and a reader's thirst for suspense.In exploring a controversial rape case, Picoult takes us to the depths of hell, both in Dante's Inferno and a graphic comic strip supposedly written and drawn by the character Daniel Stone. However, you don't have to be a sci-fi, superhero worshipper to appreciate this extra. I'm not, but that didn't stop me from searching for the encrypted message in the strip. Finding it was like taking a souvenir home from a frightening, yet thrilling ride through hell."

B0006BV6RY,Wuthering Heights (College classics in English),,A1FC1SJ397HWOW,Daniel,19/19,5.0,952300800,A novel unsurpassed in it's force of being.,"Emily Jane Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights not to show what love IS. But what love can DO to those who are encompassed by desire. This novel is simply brilliant and by far the greatest novel of the Brontes and (in my opinion) the greatest novel ever written. I say this because Emily laid aside all the conventional types of victorian writing and imbued her novel with persons and events that are not ordinary, but utterly fascinating. Almost completely unrealistic at times, yet perfectly sound in their meanings. Some say to me that Wuthering Heights is impossible to enjoy. While others say they dislike the characters so much that they had to stop reading. I also hear that they cannot figure out all the plot twist and turns. But I say, is this not what REAL-LIFE is? There is no certainty of happiness in the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff. Certainly there is no certainty of happiness for ANYONE in the novel. (Which goes the same for all of us.) As wretched as this seems, Emily (in my opinion) did not write a full blown epic of true romance, despite what many say they love about this novel. She took humans and turned them into what is surprizingly MORE realistic. Emily filled them with faults and turned Cathy and Heathcliff into selfish and undeserving people who destroy each other, not out of love, but out of greed and their own unharnessable animal-like behaviour of what love was TO THEM. What they do and say isn't romantic, but a sign (or even a warning from Emily) of what self indulgence and obsession can do to people pushed beyond their limits of common sense. Cathy and Heathcliff brought themselves to believe that their love was REAL, when in fact their grasp of love was (as Charlotte said, PERVERTED.) Unrelenting in it's destructivness, thus leading to the various calamities their actions bestowed upon the (somewhat) innocent people surrounding them. As brilliant as this novel is, the greatness lies in the story telling of the many different characters we meet. The many different view points from Nellie to Edgar to Isabella and Hindley, spread across the pages and show you how they interact and react with one another as they expierence the situations which seem so very wild and incredible yet ring so very true. This (to me) is not exactly a novel about unbending love. But more of a study of the weaknesses that is stored in everyman. Emily gave us a written guide to show that following your instincts and passions is not always the best path to take. And Emily accomplished this with the most brilliant and unsurpassed written novel in history. It's pages burn with life and it's characters speak in tongues which, even now, I cannot always fully understand. Wuthering Heights can be looked upon as a fascinating study of a particular human race (at what could be any time frame) covering the ground of but a few persons, admist the many open miles...

Well, she has gone on to make them eat those words as every one is now a bestseller. I absolutely love to read, but in this instance, I actually prefer to enjoy the audio tapes simply because they are done by the great Tim Curry. As Grimes does Brit humor to perfection, Tim brings Richard Plant, Melrose Plant and his indomitable Aunt Agatha so perfectly. Curry slips into one character after another with such panache - right down to children. The combination of Grimes and Curry is just not to be missed.In the Anodyne Necklace, a violin, an ancent emerald necklace and a severed finger are clue to solving the ghastly murder in the wood of Littlebourne.

B000P3LVZA,Brave New World,,A3KMUVYO3DX6PA,Jonathan Evans,0/0,5.0,1027468800,An Important Read....,"I used to carry the title of this book in a hip-holster ready to draw on any quasi-intellectual inquiry into my literary pallette as the &quot;most important book I'd ever read&quot;. It occured to me recently that although I seemed to feel somewhere in my bones that this statement was true, I hadn't read the book for over six years and couldn't even remember the name of the main character. That being said, having recently devoured Aldous Huxley's landmark novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;, I must most empahtically again declare that this is one of THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!What makes a book important? I think it has something to do with how well its themes and sentiments resonate with the world you experience from day to day. A quantity measured only by how many more truths you can see in unexpected places like the news, the grocery store, or a conversation around the water bubbler. &quot;A Brave New World&quot;, though written at the beginning of the century, seems to have been written with a vision and a penetrating lesson for today.The world described in Huxley's account is streamlined by science and technology, driven by open-ended corporate goals, and carried on the backs of a populace socially-trained from birth to continue an existence without question or meaning. It's a world shackled by a facism with no face or name. Contrary to Orwell's visions of a future entrapped by the ever-present 'Big Brother', Huxley's version of slavery is one enforced by ignorance and pleasure. A theme that seems well-suited to the comfortably worked, television-encased, numbed to violence and tradgedy, pill-popping, bacteria petri-dish America that exists today. It's impossible to read this book without seeing even some of his most outrageous symbolism come alive in the reality of today. To say it is a book that resonates is an understatement. To say that it is an important read is necessary."

Therefore it could be said to be an entertaining novel and provides an insight into human rights. However one problem with this book is that there is hardly anything positive written about the islamic world which makes one think that it is a little biased and therefore the information presented is not trustable. Every religion has its positive and negative sides. This book totally focuses on the negative aspects of the Saudi Arabian world. I understand that SOME saudi men might be cruel but there might be some who are more from the modern world and respect women's rights. I would say that one should just read it, contemplate a little about womens rights in the world but then try not to base Saudi Arabia by this book! In other words try not to stereotype people!"

Southerington,9/12,4.0,1068422400,Not quite good enough,"The Bedford Introduction To Drama, in its Fourth edition, has a number of virtues. Much of the selection is good, the illustrations are good and often helpful, and the introductions to each period and to individual plays are often very good. Of course, some of them are predictable: it would be nice to see some exciting Strindberg for a change; Miss Julie is really getting weary. However, it is when when we reach the second half of the Twentieth century that the quality breaks down. We find the same tired list of plays chosen for their political correctness: something on race, something for feminists, etc, etc, with very litte convincing attention paid to what has actually happened in the theatre, viewed either from the point of view of box officee appeal (which was a good enough criterion for Shakespeare), or what is likely to be historically influential. A major exception is Mamet's OLEANNA, guaranteed to stir disagreement and excitement in the classroom as it does in the theatre. Each reader will find other exceptions, but the predictability and tedium of the modern selection is disappointing. This text is widely used in classrooms, incuding my own, because there is no satisfactory alternative, but as a text for modern theatre it's a failure, and it's VERY expensive for a student's budget."

B000H1IHA2,LIARS POKER,,AY0TP71AT4KKN,Clifford Anderson,3/4,5.0,1175990400,Scenes from Salomon Brothers in the 1980's,"Reading Liar's Poker today confirms its status as a modern classic about Wall Street. Michael Lewis depicts the boom years at Salomon Brothers in the mid-1980's with a style that is simultaneously sharp and laugh-out-loud hilarious.As a complete outsider to Wall Street, I enjoyed the opportunity to get this insider's perspective on the culture of investment banking. Lewis cleverly combines his personal narrative of getting hired, going through the training program, and landing a job as a bond salesman in Salomon's soon-to-overheat London office with a more objective recounting of the key figures and episodes that led to Salomon's downfall.Lewis's most colorful portraits are of Lewie Renieri, the man who practically invented the mortgage bond market, and Michael Milken, the `junk bond king' who made Drexel Burnham into Salomon's toughest competitor. Strangely, Lewis's depiction of John Gutfreund, then chairman of Salomon, is less sharply delineated.For all the `animal house' behavior going on at Salomon Brothers--and Lewis tells a lot of unforgettable stories from the trading floor--the firm was also making serious financial innovations during that period. Lewis ascribes the faltering of Salomon to John Gutfreund's lack of leadership, especially for not retaining the mortgage traders who had made the firm so wealthy and for dismissing the market in junk bonds during its most profitable stage.Michael Lewis recounts his experiences at Salomon with a kind of detached irony; he avoids either glorifying the wealth Salomon created or deriding its culture of greed and gluttony. He recognizes that he and his fellow traders were being paid far more than they were contributing to society: ""...if social contribution had been the measure, I should have been billed rather than paid at the end of the year."" But Lewis does not condemn Wall Street. Ultimately, he suggests that Wall Street functions best when salesmen and traders value long-term relationships over making short-term profits."

In ""Ghost"" which was my favorite, Blue is living in a world with a mask,(one that the world could accept) and black is his tormented soul, struggling because he was in hiding. At some point Black decides to show himself, but he knows once revealed there is no going back. This story for me revolves around searching for truth, giving up everything in order to do so. Black begins to realize that writing is no longer serving a purpose, ""This book offers him nothing, there is no story, no plot, no action nothing but a man sitting alone in a room writing a book."" Black is killed, does blue live on? He has lost touch with that part of himself, he has thrown it aside for loftier pursuits, at least that is what was implied. Why is this story called 'Ghost'? For me this implies that it is a haunting of sorts, someone who is not whole, who is tormented and who is trying to determine whether their perception of the world is real.Very interesting stories that leave you pondering through out, Highly recommended, but for me deserves another reading."

Deeply personal, there's nothing dry about the author's rendering of these entirely subjective and haunting reminiscences.He describes the friends he made and lost, and the loss of his own innocence as he sees the absurdity of the Soviet propaganda machine, comes to understand the enemy, and finally realizes that the only thing that makes any sense are the bonds between himself and his fellow soldiers.The black and white photos that the author took during his deployment play as large a role in the book as the prose. They are not photojournalistic shots of combat, but depict the moments between the bullets, sometimes heartbreakingly accompanied with descriptions of how and when the men depicted died.This book is a sort of letter of love to the author's fellow men-at-arms: draftees and volunteers, at turns confused, brash, scared, duplicitous and tender.

My first reaction was that Richard Bach must have been on drugs and that the book was blasphemy. But because a very dear friend whom I trusted completely insisted I read it, I did - over and over and over. Eventually it began to sink in.I was at a point in my life where I was really struggling with just being alive. I didn't like myself, and I didn't like my life. I was mad that &quot;rotten things kept happening to me&quot;. I'd quit a job I liked because of an impossibly bad manager, and that made me mad. I was going thru a divorce (why had that happened to me?) and that made me mad. I was mad a lot. &quot;Illusions&quot; changed that. Not over night - I was far too stubborn and comfortable blaming everyone and everything else for my 'bad luck' to immediately change my perspective. But change it did, and &quot;Illusions&quot; was the catalyst.There is no in-between with this book. Either you get it or you don't. If you do, then read the 2 follow-ons, &quot;Bridge Across Forever&quot; and &quot;One&quot;. If you don't, then you're probably not going to evolve beyond where you are right now. &quot;Illusions&quot; is about personal power and responsibility. If you want someone or something to run your life, to be responsible for the things that happen, then this is not the book for you. If you're ready to accept that we do create our reality (Norman Vincent Peale called it 'the power of positive thinking' - same thing, different words), then read &quot;Illusions&quot;.

B000MU8Z14,Louise Bourgeois' Spider : The Architecture of Art-Writing,,A35YVK0BLDWJZG,Wayne Andersen,2/2,5.0,1011052800,Louise Bourgeois's Black Widow Spider,"This review by Wayne Andersen was published in Common Knowledge.Louise Bourgeois's monumental sculpture, Spider, currently installed in London's Tate Modern, stands so far outside the standard notion of sculpture that to call it sculpture is to say there's no such thing as sculpture. Mieke Bal translates Spider into a theoretical object, coalescing, in an expostulating narrative, theoretical thought with visual articulation of that thought in the various materials and objects that structure and consist of Spider-its mixed media egg case between huge bronze legs: a femme-maison, or Frauenzimmer, the spider is female of course, her egg case a house, a woman-house.In Bal's terms, this theoretical object deploys its visual status to articulate thought about art as internal to the work of art, like within a womb, house, or dream, the spider's egg case's shell a chain-link fence, within it a mother's lap in the form of a chair, perfume bottles hanging on a chain, segments of marrow bone wired to the fence, brooches and medals, a grandfather's watch, a tiny locket, eggs in a wire basket, other stuff-all there to puzzle over, the chair not to be sat in, dangling objects not to be touched, only approached as behind one's eyes or within the spaces of one's mind. ""Come into my parlor,"" the spider says through an open door one dare's not enter.Bal admits that her construal of Spider as theoretical object is as much about her approach to the work as about the work itself-how to see it, to write about it-which might prompt one to question whether her essay competes with the object as if to erase it. If, on behalf of the object, an explanation of it does supplant it, thus becoming it, one confronts a tautology, such as Paul Gauguin's saying, ""An explanation of the man is the work of the man,"" interpolated in Bal's case as, ""an explanation of the work of art is the work of art,"" a double bind familiar to critics when passing from material description to an interpretive phase, aware that what can be described is the property of the work under scrutiny while interpretation resides solely within the observer (as in saying, I came, I saw, I conquered, the enemy erased, the victor left to mourn the loss). So, after reading Bal's essay one might find her interpretation having foreclosed on Spider, leaving it bereft of its theoretical objecthood. In spite of that possibility befalling a seduced reader, Bal's narrative, which is neither historical nor biographical but omnipresent and transcendental, is itself a theoretical object that holds to itself so tightly as to be independent of the work-a covering narrative that can be pulled off the work, leaving its irreducible mystery intact and open for anyone capable of plumbing its depth. In short, Bourgeois' Spider is approachable but not to be subjugated, and unlike its referent, too big to be squashed.Bal is exceptionally skilled at close reading, and the subjects she chooses to take on are commensurate in complexity to that skill. Louise Bourgeois, now in her nineties, came through French Surrealism of the 1930s into New York art of the 1940s and 50s. To say the least about her, she is ineffable; to say the least about her work, it is beyond comprehension by any mode of art-writing that quails within boundaries, like fenced-in theories unwilling to bleed. To relieve the pressure of Bal's text, as relentlessly demanding as it is generous, the distressed reader might fall into giddiness and recall a clip from a Marx Brothers film with Groucho waist-hugging a woman twice his corporeality who says, ""Oh! Hold me closer,"" to which Groucho responds, ""If I held you any closer, I'd be behind you."" No critic that I've read (Rosalind Krauss notwithstanding) has embraced Bourgeois' Spider closer than Bal, who gets behind the work, all around it, and through it, exhausting all permutations. Her essay is intellectual adventuring into a dense thicket of what's possible when knowable unknowns are forced into being known and secrets induced to tattle on themselves. Tag along with her, try to keep up, forewarned that from where she is headed there may be no way back."
0812966929,Number9Dream,10.2,A3NZB70HP23X4J,Laure-Madeleine,6/7,5.0,1011312000,Dazzling Dream,"Twenty-year-old Eiji Miyake travels to the hyperkinetic, frenetic city of Tokyo in this second novel by David Mitchell, the English expatriate author of 'Ghostwritten' who lives in Hiroshima, Japan. Eiji-san has come to Tokyo to discover the identity of his long-lost father, and it's this quest that propels the narrative through the twists and turns, bumps and bells of its pachinko machine-driven plot. Eiji-san can only control the speed at which he plays this game of life that often slips over into the surreal; otherwise he haphazardly bounces around Tokyo and its environs, bumping into random people who befriend him and betray him.Mr. Mitchell readily admits that he has been much influenced by Haruki Murakami ('The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,' 'Sputnik Sweetheart') and Don DeLillo ('Underworld,' 'White Noise,' 'The Body Artist') in writing 'number9dream.' Readers who are fond of these two authors and their works will love this book. The title, 'number9dream,' echoes the fascination that John Lennon had for the number nine; his 1974 song '#9 Dream' peaked at '9' on the charts. ('So long ago / Was it in a dream, was it just a dream? / I know, yes I know / Seemed so very real, it seemed so real to me.')The story begins: 'It is a simple matter. I know your name, and you knew mine, once upon a time: Eiji Miyake. Yes, that Eiji Miyake. We are both busy people, Ms Kato, so why not cut the small talk? I am in Tokyo to find my father. You know his name and his address. And you are going to give me both. Right now.' Or something like that.' Yes, something like that, because it's not such a simple matter after all. Slipping into the surreal, the realm of sci fi and phantasmagoria, Eiji Miyake soon inhabits a parallel universe. He goes about his day-to-day affairs, yet the narrative glides onto a giant turntable where the record that's playing repeats 'number nine . . . number nine . . . number nine.'Eiji's quest leads him into the underbelly of the Tokyo scene, where he encounters the Yakusa. Does his father have a connection to the Yakusa? The origin of the Yakusa - Japanese for 'they without worth to society' - can be traced back to 1612; they were masterless samurai, ronin, wandering robber bands, who, after the industrialization of Japan, have transformed themselves into Armani-suited gangsters, who some call the Japanese Mafia. The code of the Yakusa and the structure of their organization is complex, but David Mitchell navigates their terrain with consummate skill.After Eiji-san has met up with the Yakusa, he is then warned that he 'must persuade himself that tonight was another man's nightmare into which you accidentally strayed.' Yet the reality of Eiji Miyake's life is haunted and tainted by nightmares and dreams as he time-travels from his cozy capsule in Tokyo to his grandmother's home on the foggy island of Yakushima. In these flashbacks, he confronts ghosts and thunder gods while he seeks clues to the mystery-shrouded death of his twin sister, Anju. As Leatherjacket had told him earlier, 'nightmares are our wilder ancestors returning to reclaim land. Land tamed and grazed, by our softer, fatter, modern, waking selves.'Through an unusual encounter in the Amadeus Tea Room with an elderly gentleman who may be Eiji-san's grandfather, he comes into the possession of a diary that was written by a kaiten pilot, who, while part of the Japanese Imperial Navy, was stationed off the coast of an island in the Ryuku chain during World War II. The journal entries, as they are read by Miyake in his capsule, are enthralling. Woven throughout other sections in the novel are a fabulist's tale, with oddball characters named Goatwriter and Mrs Combs, and a love story with Ai Imajo, a talented pianist. Unlike the narrative of 'Ghostwritten,' a novel of nine interlinked short-storied chapters plus one, the well-knit storyline of 'number9dream' doesn't unravel or drop any stitches as it goes along.Some may say that 'number9dream' is no more than a Manga comic strip with cartoon characters and gratuitous violence, but they are missing the allusions and subtleties and humor that lightly grace the pages of this postmodern odyssey. 'number9dream' is a nonlinear novel in nine parts, a multilayered narrative that explores the nature of dreams and reality. Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2001, this novel is so extraordinary that you'll want to read it again and again and again."

I really liked the other stories but I didn't think they hung together very well. It was almost like King was trying to please his fans (who like to be scared - story 1) while being a *serious* writer as well (the other stories). Does he care that much about critical opinion? I noticed in Low Men that he makes some poorly veiled digs at literary critics (eg. about *real writers*) - does he have a complex that his writing is not taken seriously? My advice Steve if you're reading this (as if) is to forget the critics and think of your adoring fans - write for us, and scare us stupid, please!"
B000IZW9II,PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE,,A3BT7PRPVH8HBI,Reader From Aurora,10/12,3.0,1188604800,Better May be Available,"Philosophy of Language by William Lycan is an instalment in the Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy Series. This series is intended to provide a bridge between introductory and advanced study, primarily aimed at students/readers with some prior exposure to academic philosophy.Overall, this is a solid addition to the contemporary introductions series. Philosophy of language can be an arcane and jargon-laden field. Lycan's methodology is generally helpful, introducing many of the key thinkers, and concepts, in the modern philosophy of language tradition (e.g. Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, etc.) The approach employed in the text is to introduce a philosopher's key thoughts then consider objections and potential retorts. This is not a bad tactic, however, from my perspective greater focus on a few key points would be preferable to the current emphasis on breadth (some of the points are too trivial or technical for an introductory text). Each section is followed by a summary of key points, questions for discussion and suggestions for further reading. Additionally, from a physical standpoint the paper back version is well constructed and has a usable font size.Strengths aside, two stylistic weaknesses reduced my enjoyment of the text and its ultimate utility. The more trivial is the author's excessive self-reference, e.g. ""your humble narrator"", ""you were expecting me to recommend someone else {referring to himself)?"" etc. I think that this may have been done with the intention of adding levity to an otherwise dense and potentially dry subject. It was, however, over done and distracting; most of these comments should be removed. The second, and more significant, weakness is style. There is academic writing that is pleasant and flowing, and then there is writing that is laborious and plodding. Unfortunately, this text is in the latter category- even being familiar with the material I found myself constantly having to re-read sections in order to get the point. I fear that if used as a textbook it may turn students off this field.Upon reflection, I realize that my muted reaction to the book has two components; how the topic is approached and articulated (discussed above), and the subject itself. On this latter point, though intellectually interesting in its own right, much later-day work in this field by Searle, Grice, Davidson, et al, strikes me as adding little real value. Their type of logical-linguistic minutia, though fascinating in its own way, seems analogous to some of the worst medieval theological musings. To progress, it appears that the analytical tradition may need to blend with the behavioural sciences and consider communication from a broader perspective.Overall, a solid if dry piece of academic writing. A background in analytic philosophy may be required to fully engage with, and integrate, this material. Although, I do not have a ready recommendation there are likely better introductory texts available."

Related to this question two more further, fundamental questions are asked : Do the financial markets encourage a short-termist,profits-only mentality that ignores much human and environmental reality ? Or are they simply tools that reflect human concerns, and so will eventually reflect disquiet over poverty and the degradation of nature by rewarding companies that treat people and the environment in a responsible manner ?In an attempt to find answers, the authors examined both the working of financial markets (established and emerging) and the roles of different key players in the financial community.The findings are mixed but overall encouraging. For each player the present situation is explained in detail, showing clearly the limitations, the potential risks and potentials each player has related to creating sustainable development.Overall a difficult topic in which the authors did very well to give a detailed present situation. Highly recommended as a first but good introduction to this topic.Contents : I The Game 1. Eco-efficiency and the Financial Markets 2.

At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like it, as I am not really into Wicca. The title is a bit misleading: Morgan Le Fay's book of Spells and Wiccan Rituals. I thought it was going to be Arthurian Wicca or something. But wow, although the Wicca stuff is there for those who want it, what the author has put together is a blend of different spells/visualizations/workings based on various dieties and energies--all very empowering--all very user friendly.The spells themselves are tailored to practical real life situations. The supplies needed and processes required are also practical and easily attainable. No arcane toe of dog required here, just beautiful words and evocative images!One more thing, I don't usually rave about introductions butI've not read as succinct and informative an intro on the history of Wicca in I don't know when.For what you get. The price is more than right. Don't overlook this delightful little book. Here's to pleasant and magickal surprises!"

However, there are too many political arguments that make the story boring. This book is also rather predictable, as the reader can guess what will happen next. I think that a strengthening of the plot in certain areas would make the book more enjoyable. While some parts are breathtaking, other parts are sappy and uninteresting. I'd reccomend this type of book to those who don't mind a political conflict now and then, who like romance and history, and who want to have a look back in time at what life was like back then. I sort of liked the novel, and then sort of didn't, for all of the reasons mentioned here."

Well, i was really glad i did because, with the exception of Abbas' graphics, especially the cell-cell interactions, Janeways book is significantly better. The language used in this book is rushed and confusing that resulted in me, more times than not, reaching for the trusted Janeway (which I now dubb 'The Bible'). I would only recommend Abbas's Basic immunology for those who need to cram for an exam in a very short time. For all else, if you really like immunology and like Abbas' way with his pictures, 'Cellular and Molecular Immunology' also by Abbas would be better, or even better Janeways 'Immunobiology'."

I have trouble understadning why everyone enjoyed it so much. The writing evoked very little emotion in me, which is especially surprising considering some of the sad moments in this book. I never felt who the characters truly were nor what they were feeling. The overused references to the Home felt so forced, it was more like a reading an assignment in middle school.

The book takes place in the future where the main character, Alex, and his fellow ""droogs"" cause chaos and use their own invented slang throughout the book. Alex cannot help being violent, it is just who he is. He and his ""droogs"" go around beating people up, causing disturbance to the society around them, and rape. The book then takes a turn and Alex tries to change who he is and redeem himself; yet can you change who you naturally are? It offers the question of free will and the struggle between good and bad. It also shows the maturing and growing up into adulthood and change of mind. It is a page turner and a fascinating novel."
0786192224,"Munich Signature (Zion Covenant, Book 3)",,A2O5RT4RCC4NU2,Nina M. Osier,6/6,5.0,1231718400,"Another excellent installment in the ""Zion Covenant"" series","German-born violinist Elisa Linder (or Lindheim) and American journalist John Murphy have turned their marriage of convenience into a real union, at last. Elisa's family has found safe haven in Prague. Her close friend Leah Feldstein is on the way to Italy, via the dangerous passes from Austria, while Shimon Feldstein - Leah's husband - suffers as a slave laborer in a Nazi steel mill. Leah shepherds one of the five-year-old twin boys rescued from the Nazis in an earlier volume of this series. The other twin, Charles, travels with Elisa and her husband. The boys' parents have been murdered, and little Charles marked as a ""mutant"" unfit to live because of his harelip. Which a Jewish physician who has already fled Germany for New York City waits to repair, as soon as Elisa and Murphy bring the child to him. That's where this third installment of the Zion Covenant series begins. It ends with Britain's Prime Minister Chamberlain and other, like-minded government officials turning the Sudetenland over to Hitler without a fight, in order to achieve ""peace in our time.""Munich Signature introduces a new and powerful character in Trudence ""Bubbe"" (Grandmother) Rosenfelt, a 78-year-old widow who married a Hamburg man and raised her family there. Her family in Hamburg now consists of a married granddaughter, that granddaughter's husband, and their five small daughters. Bubbe Rosenfelt will not use her U.S. citizenship to return home to Brooklyn, New York until she finds a way to get her loved ones out of Germany, and the roadblocks she encounters are only partly of German construction. American unwillingness to bend rigid quotas and other immigration rules proves far harder to overcome than Nazi unwillingness (real though it is) to let the Jews escape Hitler's plans for a final solution. There may be a way, though, Mrs. Rosenfelt learns when she persists in troubling a U.S. Embassy official. If she has enough money to pay outrageous fees for their passage, and if her family is willing to board a rusting, incredibly overcrowded freighter. Meanwhile, both the Gestapo and British Intelligence stalk Elisa, because the latter organization recognizes how useful this woman can be if compelled to serve as an operative.Once again Bodie and Brock Thoene produce a fast-paced, emotionally stirring tale based solidly on real events. Their characters, while fictitious, feel just as real. I was particularly impressed in this book by John Murphy's gradual inner journey from cheerful disregard for the religion of his childhood to actively seeking God's help. While the book's text sometimes does lapse into preaching (which will please some readers while annoying others), there is nothing ""preachy"" about Murphy's transformation by God's grace. It happens naturally, in a fine example of how character development ought to be handled in any novel.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of HIGH PLACES and 2005 EPPIE winner REGS"

I liked the author's ability to reveal both the admirable and unappealing personality traits of each character through routine situations and conversation. There are no clear heroes or villains. After reading too many book covers which start with ""they were happy, successful, beautiful,, until..."", I enjoyed reading a book that doesn't preach the cliche ""life is not the destination, but the journey"", but rather reveals this all too truthful phrase through someone else's eyes"

I've been in publishing for over 20 years and was amazed at the breadth of information included in this book. There are thousands of publishing milestones presented in chronological order--not to mention the beautiful full-color artwork. In addition, the CD-ROM version is a great way to search for a specific glossary term or biography you're looking for. I keep a hardcopy of Publishing Timeline 2000 on my coffee table, a softcover copy in my office, and the CD-ROM right next to my computer!

B000NRXIWW,THROUGH WOLF'S EYES - with the sequel: WOLF'S HEAD WOLF'S HEART,,A2EKJOB8XFS4WK,S. Raines,10/10,5.0,1030492800,Great followup to the first book,"This book is a continuation of the story of Firekeeper and friends that started in Through Wolf's Eyes. However the story in this volume is very complete (in fact I thought it the last until I read otherwise), so you don't need to worry about being left with a cliffhanger. It should be preceded by the first book though.The story concerns three stolen magical artifacts that were in Bright Bay. On a basic level the book is a quest to regain them. On another level it's a book about the humans on the quest (Doc, Derian, Elise, and Firekeeper) continuing to mature. I loved the book on both levels, maybe because these four characters and Blind Seer are my favorites in the series.This book has less political intrigue than the first since much of it takes place outside the courts, so it has a more adventure-like feel. It's also nice to get a chance to see a bit more of the countryside, and a new city that I found intriguing. There's also a neat interlude with a conclave of the Royal Beasts, which has some good storytelling in it.All in all, an excellent sequel."
0613926218,Day the World Came to Town,,A33N05GF31KN8N,Man of La Book,0/0,4.0,1272931200,Feel Good Anecdotes,"If I started reading a book about 9/11 and a few pages into it found that an American General, a CEO of an international clothing conglomerate, several members of the board of a wealthy charity, an NYPD detective and parents of a firefighter who is lost in the World Trade Center were stuck in a small Canadian town in the middle of Newfoundland (not to mention a long-lost native son) I would have put the book away with a chuckle and started a new one.Nevertheless, this is not fiction and the events really happen.Even though I really liked the book, and even recommended it to my beloved wife, there are several glaring omissions.First and foremost for me: there is no map.The author goes to great length to describe the geographical region as well as the Gander's street layout (which is supposed to be shaped like the head of a moose) - yet...no map?I find this to be unbelievable.Second, the writing seems more like a collection of articles than a finished book. That's fine and it didn't bother me that much but I thought I should mention it.Third, it would be nice to have appendices with a chart of the flights, departure, landings at Gander International Airport, etc.Fourth, I would have liked to see more pictures. Again, this does not take away from the book but would have been a nice addition. There are several pictures in the book but they are small and grainy (much like...a newspaper article).Fifth, where is the tourist info for Newfoundland? Come on guys, capitalize on this book. I've been to your area (but not Gander), it is a beautiful, gorgeous part of the world and true to the book - some of the nicest people in the world live there.However, I still this book high marks because I did thoroughly enjoyed it since it is about the people of Newfoundland and not about the big events happening around them. The only part which took away my personal enjoyment was the first bullet point I mentioned (and yes, I did google the town and found the map but I still can't ""see"" the moose head layout)."

I remember the first ~200 pages being excruciating, then the last 40 or so transforming the novel for me (for the positive). It's in the end where the themes really came together for me; it might not be a coincidence this is when Maisie really begins to emerge as an active character. Throughout the novel she passively absorbs the actions of her bourgeois parents, step-parents, their lovers, etc. Then, finally, she tries to apply what she understands, through the filter of her consciousness (and imagination), and becomes a participant in the intrigues and romances floating about her. She doesn't understand it's not her time; the object of her affections is cynical and weak, but not debauched, and in fact she is the aggressor. He tries to guide the burgeoning light of her consciousness as best he can. In the end I thought the novel was a lovely story about a child's encounter with the wall of possibility, the reconcilation of imagination with human limits."

Wintersmith is one of those books that has you reminiscing about your own early teen years, while looking for a special teen your life (child, neighbor's kid, niece) to whom you can buy the set of books for, because you know they are going to love them and learn from them.Mr. Pratchett is a true student, and teacher, of the human condition. His understanding encompasses not only the simplest mentalities (think Nobby), but easily walks you through the greatest, most complex minds (Lord Vetinari). And he does it with great humor and great compassion.I've met Mr. Pratchett in person just once, but there are some people in life whom you know are good people, and very, very gifted people. Terry Pratchett is both.Do yourself and anyone you care about who likes to read a favor - try any of his Discworld books (sorry, haven't read the others so couldn't comment on those) and see what you think.

For almost three years I've been trying to reconcile the contradictory definitions of Islam (and more importantly political Islam) set by both the religion's detractors and adherents. Finally Joseph Lumbard's book paints a lucid picture of the plight of modern Islam, the precarious struggle between Islamic traditionalism and modernism, and the intellectual slip-ups of the religion's &quot;fundamentalist&quot; misinterpreters. Of course some essays are stronger than others (see the Winter article), though the book is consistent in its high level of scholarship. In fact, it sets the standard for the post 9-11 Islamic academic discourse. At 14 bucks, this book is a steal on many levels (not the least of which being its high-quality printing and format), and I highly recommend it for anybody remotely interested in Islam, political science, religious studies, or current events.

But the condescending nature of his monologue translates extremely over 200 pieces of narcissistic ranting and pontificating about a sport that he knows absolutely nothing about. His access to his subjects was extremely limited which it came to light that he was violating the ethics of reporting by airing information that truly off the record. If only that applied to his own actions. Then he would be going to jail for the indiscretions he committed with underage boys and girls thirty to forty years ago instead of mocking and ridiculing them from the safety of his living room.

B0007JMPK2,"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups",,,,5/6,5.0,871862400,That Hideous Strength is the best of the Space Trilogy,"It seems that people either like That Hideous Strength the best or least of the Space Trilogy. I think the reason is that That Hideous Strength is very different than the other two books. It took me a couple of chapters to realize that this book was not going where Perelandra and Out of the Silent Planet went, but when I realized that I could enjoy the book on its own merits. In fact, this is my favorite book in the trilogy. Although a Christian theme runs throughout the trilogy, when it is presented in That Hideous Strength it becomes more accessible. The evil in the book could and does happen. The basic good in the book is no less extraordinary (with certain exceptions). The adventures of Ransom on other planets in the first two books of the trilogy were to prepare him for the battle on Earth in That Hideous Strenth. An interesting phenomenon of this book for me was that when I was reading about Mark and the N.I.C. E. I longed for the story to switch to Jane and the group at St. Anne's. The people at N.I.C.E. were so disagreeable and petty and backstabbing that it made me realize what C. S. Lewis was saying about the nature of evil (or the devil). This book can be read for its story alone, but it is much more rewarding if you think about the ideas and beliefs present as well.Even if you are not religious or a christian the book can inspire you to think about what you believe in."

It is very specific: a book to teach you how to use Reiki to change your core beliefs about abundance and lack. It is NOT a book designed to teach you about Reiki itself. Reiki cannot be learned from a book (Diane Stein's teachings notwithstanding, see my Amazon.com review of her book.) It IS a book to teach those who are already Reiki practitioners to use Reiki to change their lives.All too many of us carry negative beliefs about money and our right to abundance. Many of us were taught that money is &quot;bad&quot;, that only those who are not spiritual will have abundance. What nonsense! Spirit wishes us to live life with abundance, it is our birthright (see Lee Carroll's Kryon books for more info on this topic.) Horan's book provides a step-by-step program which, if followed, will disolve blockages in your life and allow the natural abundance of the universe to flow through it.I followed the program, and the changes in my life were amazing. Not overnight, but substantial nonetheless. The most important part was the change in my mental attitude, and how my life flowed from that. If you are already a Reiki practitioner who wants to change their life, buy this book! If you're interested in learning more about Reiki, find a good Master/Teacher in your area and seek training from them. A teacher is vital, you cannot learn it alone. But once learned, the changes in your life will astound you! I have been praticing Reiki since 1994, and have been a traditionally trained Master/Teacher since 1998. Feel free to email me for more info on this book or Reiki in general."

No, we aren'tthrough an economic depression, but I haveobserved that a lot of people would like thegovernment to control more about their lives,which has the potential to lead to a fascistdictatorship. I know, people might say &quot;Itcan't happen here&quot;, just like in the book, but Ithink that Sinclair Lewis was right in theidea that it could happen."

It will assist in confirming that all companies need to develop behavioral, or in this case, Emotional Intelligence models of successful workers in all positions. My company uses a tool, Zero Risk Hiring System, to measure emotional intelligence to define success profiles and to hire people who possess these thinking skill sets. I can't say enough how this book will lead you to rethinking your personnel management paradigms."

B0007BXQ8K,The sheltering sky,,,,7/18,2.0,875577600,"A major motion picture??? You're kidding, right?","For a man who has spent decades living in Morocco, Paul Bowles does a poor job of bringing the Sahara Desert to life in his novel, The Sheltering Sky. After reading the book, I was honestly surprised to find that he lived in and around the Sahara for so many years. I had already forgiven this shortcoming of the author as a valiant attempt by a non-African when I was disappointed to find that the opposite was the case. Bowles' limited powers of description are not a result of his life experience.The Sheltering Sky lacks structure and character development, is rambling and at times supremely boring, and leaves many loose ends dangling in the desert wind. Many of the decisions made by the characters in the book leave the reader baffled because Bowles gives a minimum of background information on them. While this may be called Bowles' &quot;style&quot; by some, it is more likely that the true culprit is amateurism. This is the kind of book that you finish in hopes of a fantastic ending with a few plot twists, but Bowles disappoints and leaves you feeling as empty as the desert landscape. He really misses the opportunity to bring back some of the characters he loses along the way.I am amazed that there are plans to make a major motion picture out of this book. The Sahara Desert will surely provide a boring visual complement to an already boring story. Though there are some cheap sex scenes in the story (which will likely be over-dramatized for public interest) the movie will, and should, flop."

B00008AJCF,Tuxedo Park: A Wall Street Tycoon and the Secret Palace of Science That Changed the Course of World War II,,A37F1G84K35FCZ,taking a rest,86/92,5.0,1024876800,Thank You Jennet Conant,"With her biography of Alfred Lee Loomis through her book, ""Tuxedo Park"", Jennet Conant has given those interested the best view yet of this extraordinary man. I have read many books regarding Wall Street when Mr. Loomis was a player, and many other books on the exchange of information between Great Britain and The United States during World War II, specifically on radar and atomic weapons. The name Loomis is a vague one at best, happily Ms. Conant has remedied this gap in the historical record and delivers a great deal of knowledge about the man and his talents.Exceptional would be an appropriate word to describe this man. A major financier on Wall Street, he not only was unhurt by the crash of 1929 he benefited from it. While enjoying after dinner conversation he could also play multiple games of chess with his back to the boards, carrying on both the conversation and the multiple games in his mind's eye alone. Clearly a man with a formidable intellect, it is not altogether shocking that after making a huge fortune on Wall Street, he walked away from it and the boards he served on to pursue other interests, interests that would have a major impact on the outcome of the Second World War.A capitalist to his core, when the need arose for development of important scientific research he routinely would take the money from his own pocket. Over the years this amounted to huge sums of money, and much was spent long before there was the urgency of war. He encouraged and financed the best minds in physics, literally feeding and housing them in a house turned private laboratory in one of the country's wealthiest enclaves Tuxedo Park. Write down any name from Einstein to Fermi to a host of Nobel winners and they all spent time at his homes on many occasions.And this man was just not a wanna-be with deep pockets. Whether it was innovations with radar, cyclotrons, or getting the armed forces to sit up and pay attention to devices they were in desperate need of, or gathering the money and talent to do whatever was required, he was the facilitator, and he literally made it happen. He also understood the science he was assisting.Without his organizing the manpower and the facilities to produce devices that were recently just science fiction, the tools that were so critical to winning the war would have taken years to develop if left to the federal government. The armed forces were of little help as they were inherently protective of their own turf and distrustful of the other branches and especially of the, ""long hair"", physicists. He also bridged the gap of distrust when the British wanted to share innovations The United States was nowhere near to developing. Fortunately diplomacy was almost as offensive to him as a federally run science project, so when the diplomats were arguing he would go off in to a corner and start swapping information.There were two events described in the book that are priceless. They not only illustrate all that is wrong with bureaucracy but also protecting one's turf when the turf is the same country. These events also proved why privately run efforts would beat Washington every day of the week. The military routinely dismissed the ideas and instruments that were suggested and then built. Mr. Loomis and his people knew better and they would go ahead and build a dozen prototypes, demonstrate them to the top brass, and watch the feeding frenzy begin. After watching these people who hours before had no time to waste on these ideas much less the actual product, Mr. Loomis would politely interject that all the arguing was unnecessary, as the devices were owned by him. The looks on the faces must have been worth any frustration leading up to the moment. All the infighting stopped as the bureaucrats and generals realized they were fighting over what was not theirs. The bickering stopped, and the results of the incredible researchers and Loomis were happily accepted, and orders for countless more were placed.The book is a very well written account a man who did not want history's attention, and until this book largely avoided it. He is gone now but the implements created by his money, his determination, patriotism, and the huge groups he assembled, are still in use today. They have advanced exponentially in their capabilities, but many started or were nurtured in Tuxedo Park. This country owes a major debt to this visionary."

Kaku, a physicist at Princeton, has written one of the best surveys of what modern scientists and mathematicians are struggling with - namely resolving the paradox of reconciling quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of gravity to come to the Theory of Everything, which would explain our universe from its beginning to its eventual end. Kaku writes that in mathematics and theory, it is simpler and more elegant to come at such a theory when dealing with higher dimensions, and thereby introduces ideas such as superstring theory, which works strangely enough, in only 10 and 26 dimensions. Although Kaku deals with the fascinating ideas of parallel worlds, time travel and etc., he examines and approaches these ideas not with a feverish enthusiasm of a sci-fi hack, but with a sober scientific analysis; he quickly puts down many of these sci-fi ideas on scientific grounds while proposing a tantalizing possibility of existence of others.It's not these ideas themselves but Kaku's presentation of them that deserves merit. These ideas have been written about before by other writer/scientists, but never have all the ideas been so convincingly unified and energetically explained for all people. I have no background in science, and found this book fascinating to read for its ideas and passion. There are humorous biographical and autobiographical anecdotes. Many of the concepts are illustrated (albeit a bit poorly), and Kaku does an excellent job of giving us examples for visualization of a concept that he wants to get across.This is an excellent book that serves as an important introduction to one of the central inquiries of modern physics - finding a unified theory to explain the nature of the universe itself."

Perhaps that is in part because novels like Eliot's laid the groundwork for a typology of characters that can now be referred to in shorthand. But I think it is also because we no longer find meaning in that kind of contemplation, rather we leap immediately to analyze, ironize, & distance.It is truly an astonishing piece of work and while I have other favorites, I can think of no better writing in English."

The story is one that I could see myself in because although I have been in a relationship with the same man for over 20 years, I have, as I am sure other woman have, gone through periods where I look at him and wonder if I realy know this person. The Pilots Wife is one of those books that makes you wonder if you have the same ability to love someone, know someone and yet be so naive about them and in some ways yourself. I have recommended this book to my teenage daughter because of the sensitive story it tells, you want to know who and how they survive. There is never enough time in the day to read the amount that I would love to, but for this book, I made the time. I don't remember the last time I ripped through a book as quickly as this one!"

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle must be one of the best authors the world has ever seen. The way he has written it makes it seem that Sherlock Holmes is averagely smart but very observant often puzzling his long time friend Dr. Watson with his strange behaviour when he is close to unravelling the cases. He often stuns Dr. Watson when he reveals the most interesting tale which is almost always 100% correct often with the culprit confessing that they did it after hearing Holmes tell the tale.

The novel is about a fire fighter named Guy Montag whose job is to actually start fires. In the society of the future, no one asks questions or thinks for themselves. Montag and his fire starting colleagues are paid to light books on fire and watch them burn. Montag meets a seventeen-year old girl who tells him about times when people treasured books and when a fireman's job was to extinguish fires. Filled with curiosity about the past, Montag starts hiding books in his home and reading them. His wife reveals his secret to his co-workers and Montag is forced to burn his own stash. Montag then meets philosophers who have stored the contents of books in their heads so that when people need and want the knowledge, it is there.Bradbury brings out a statement of theme that is not revealed without careful analysis of the story. The theme that Bradbury presents is that even the simplest things are important and make up a culture and society as we know it.

1571202072,Liberated String Quilts,,A3LWLU8DZMBYPY,Bev,6/6,5.0,1163030400,Gwen Marston is tops!,"I am a big fan of Gwen Marston. She is totally irreverant when it comes to quilters' rules. However you shouldn't think that she has no rules at all. If you purchase this book believing it's all just a piece of cake you'd be wrong. Making the basic ""string"" fabric is extremely simple, then you follow her patterns for making the blocks using this fabric. A couple of her blocks even have set-in seams which are not all that easy. A bit of quiltmaking expertise is required. But then there are the blocks like Amish Rectangular String, Arkansas Traveler, and Slanted Bars which are very simple and go together quickly. I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants a break from the Mariners Compass, Texas Star, and paper piecing quilts you've been working on. It's different! And that's not a bad thing."

Ross,15/17,4.0,925257600,A Good Use of Reading Time,"Although Kaplan attempts to style this dense book as a semi-linear travel narrative, it is actually more of an heavily footnoted eyewitness account of the dramatic transitions occurring in various developing regions. Chock full of provocative and disturbing ideas culled from many social sciences, the book starts with a largely pessimistic 89 pages of West Africa and 37 pages of Egypt. I didn't find anything particularly new or illuminating in these two sections, but they serve as a good introduction to the issues if you aren't familiar with what's happening there, although recent events somewhat date his account of West Africa in particular. It didn't take me long to get fed up with Kaplan's machine gun use of statistics to support his observations. That, and his tendency to repeat himself, undermine his attempts at literary narrative. Fortunately, I came to a deeply engrossing 45 pages of Turkey and the Caucuses, 70 pages of Iran, and 96 pages of Central Asia. These three sections were what made the book for me, even readers already familiar with the areas will find value in Kaplan's account. It was here that Kaplan seemed most comfortable and most knowledgeable. Lots of great info about the ethnic dynamics of the areas and great historical tidbits make these worth interesting even if you don't read the sections before or after. What follows is a sporadically interesting 100 pages on the Indian subcontinent and &quot;Indochina.&quot; The book is greatly aided by its maps, and Kaplan is careful to acknowledge the sources of the ideas he presents. There is also an excellent bibliography for those interested in followup reading. The great value in this book lies in Kaplan's insistence (correct in my belief) that population growth is the single most destabilizing force in the world today and that it must be addressed before all else."

This time Alex was sent to spy on an old Russian general named Sarov. Enough uranium to create a nuclear bomb that would destroy an entire country was recently purchased by Sarov. Alex went to spy on him and got captured. Sarov's plan was to detonate the bomb by four old submarines that hold 1/5 of the world's uranium supply. This would then cause about triple the amount of damage. After the bomb detonated, Sarov would bring Russia back to the old days when it was a war country and had much power in the world. Alex had to stop this from happening at all costs. Alex defuses the bomb and saves the world for the third time. He then heads off to visit his friend in the South of F France.I recommend this book to almost anyone.

Superbly Written!,"I was seriously deprived as a child and never read the ""Wind in the Willow,"" nor did I have it read to me. Given that my Mom is an avid reader and encouraged me to be one also, I don't know why this classic was omitted from my early reading repertoire. When I met my husband, he discovered I had never read Kenneth Grahame's book, and told me it was/is one of his favorites. So, the first gift I ever received from him was a copy of ""Wind in the Willows,"" inscribed ""A kid's book for a special lady, who is a child at heart."" Now the marvelous adventures of the Mole, Rat, Toad and Badger still delight, as they did that first time many years ago, when I was 19 years-old. If you are older than eight, the reading level says 4-8, and are not familiar with this tale, by all means get yourself a copy and enter the magical world created by Mr. Grahame, who wrote this as a series of bedtime stories for his son in 1908. As far as literature goes, the writing is quite lyrical, really beautiful and inventive, and so intelligent. A samples below, describes the scenery of new surroundings:""He thought his happiness complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen such a river before - this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates who shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver, glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated.""Grahame writes this exuberant, humorous fantasy, about the adventures of four close friends, all animals, who live in the English countryside, the Wild Wood, to be exact. He tells the tale from the animals' points of view, emphasizing the etiquette and sensibilities of woodland creatures, and those who make their homes and livings underground and on river banks. Throughout his narrative he explains how animal society works, and how non-human creatures perceive the world around them.Toad, of glorious Toad Hall, is a spoiled, rich, rather eccentric creature, who is accustomed to doing exactly as he wishes. Reckless, he perpetually gets himself and his friends into trouble. They count on it, in fact. Ever a free spirit, with the money to indulge his whims, Toad discovers a new passion - motor cars. Of course he involves diligent, kind-hearted Mole, very clever Water Rat, and wise, reclusive Badger in his madness, and invariably they extricate themselves from the consequences, rescuing their friend Toad as well.President Theodore Roosevelt and his family greatly enjoyed ""Wind in the Willows."" He wrote to the author praising the book. And A.A. Milne made a very popular play out of it called ""Toad of Toad Hall.""Ernest H. Shepard's original ink drawings are wonderful.JANA"

B000K3C7YY,Read My Desire : Lacan Against the Historicists,,,,8/9,5.0,964569600,A Rare Find: Quality Criticism,"I bought this book months ago and am still working my way through it, which is a good thing, because Joan Copjec has packed every single essay with the most acute insight that I feel my brain growing every time I read it. This book isn't, as it is promoted, a dialogue between historicism and psychoanalysis in which psychoanalysis wins. Rather, Copjec examines how historicists misuse or misinterpret Lacan in their theories, which she seeks to right my proposing different readings of Lacan. If this review makes no sense it's because I can't possibly wrap my brain around everything that Copjec says. Needless to say, if you have an interest in theory, read this book. The first essay on film theory is fascinating, and the emphasis on the failure of language to signify and how this failure is marked in language provides an exciting platform on which to rethink the social subject.

Jarman manages to probe the paradoxes of faith in a deep but respectful way, without veering into either hostility, on the one hand, or an easy piety on the other. &quot;Tranfiguration&quot; is a superb exploration of what it means for Christ -- for anyone -- to be subject to the law and to suffering, and how one can be transfigured by resistance to that fate. &quot;Questions for Ecclesiastes&quot; is a devastating comment on how little consolation is provided by the Bible's &quot;wisdom&quot; in the face of real tragedy, in this case the suicide of a young girl. &quot;And God . . . who could have shared what he knew with people who needed urgently to hear it, God kept a secret.&quot; Jarman uses the English language beautifully, incorporating the rhythms and cadences of the King James even when not overtly using the language.

Its ok in small doses, but here you get a great dolop, and its often tedious to deal with to get to the Hemingway of 'To Whom the Bell Tolls' and his powerful description and aversion to the waste of war.If you have difficulty stomaching the 'wet' affair of Cantwell and Renata, put this down and pick up 'To Whom....'Then come back to this to absorb yourself in his more profound interludes in this."

Hamilton since I first picked up Guilty Pleasures over ten years ago. But with her newest novel I have to say she's lost me as a reader. Over the last few books Mrs. Hamilton has focused more on sex and less on plot. Her latest book Incubus Dreams is now 95% sex, and 5% plot. Anita is now sleeping with 6 people on a regular basis, and a couple more on a not so regular basis. I don't mind sex in the books that I read, but if I wanted to read a book that is all sex I'd of picked up a book out of the erotica section. This book is supposed to be about a vampire serial killer. That plot line is barely touched on in this book at all, and it's conclusion is not particularly satisfying. Suffice to say, If I decide to read her next book I'll take it out of the library first.Save your money."
B000HJNGRS,Warrior Class,,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,Rottenberg's rotten book review,4/4,2.0,1011139200,Heavy on the techno- light on thrills,"In ""Warrior Class"", an evil Russian tycoon, Pavel Kazakov, manipulates the fragile politics of the Balkans to serve his sinister financial plans. Already rich on the strength of his drug smuggling enterprises and his 3rd world petroleum sales, Kazakov triggers a war in the Balkans as a ruse to building an oil pipeline through Albania. With the Balkans disintegrating, the Russian army pours across the border, ostensibly for peacekeeping, but mostly to pacify those who'd stand in Kazakov's way. Once complete, the oil pipeline will guarantee the Russians millions of dollars in petro-income daily. Kazakov, who's despised enough by his own countrymen, relies on back-room deals in general and in particular (because this is a Dale Brown novel) on a fantastic and mysterious stealth warplane that swoops without warning and unleashes destruction. (Rival Balkan factions blame each other for the attacks). The mystery plane is the Metyor-179, a sort of descendant of the Fisikous-170 of the earlier Brown novel ""Night of the Hawk"". In the US, a new president (who makes his habits clear by skipping such traditional functions as the public inauguration and traditional state of the union address) abruptly cuts military ties with the rest of the world - pulling out everything but a shell of the American presence from Europe and leaving a power-vacuum the Russians are only too happy to fill. At Elliot Field, site of the high-technology aero-weapons training center (HAWC), Pat Mclanahan (Dale Brown's perennial hero) is working hard not only training his own combat unit but also foreign units who will now be expected to defend themselves without overt American support. Ukrainian units in Backfire bombers train alongside Turkish F-16's and HAWC's very own EB-1c Vampire bombers. The situation is tenuous enough, but when a deep-cover CIA agent in Russia uncovers proof of Kazakov's links to the Mystery Plane and the escalating violence in the Balkans, HAWC is sent in on the rescue. The catastrophic results set off an international incident and lead to a near court martial of Mclanahan.It's a big, complicated story, one that manages to elude Dale Brown's story-telling talents with every page. Besides his usual faults (giving greater depth to machines and combat elements than the people) is a glaring new one: most of Brown's books are linked in a rough series based on the exploits of Mclanahan and others at HAWC, and Brown has no problem freely revisiting past events of those older books in the newer ones. Tossing around references to books like the original ""Flight of the Old Dog: and ""Night of the Hawk"", reading a Dale Brown novel is like reading another issue of some superhero comic book where every other plot reference has an asterisk reminding you to review last month's issue of Avenger's or X-Men. Even so, Brown leaves some threads untreated, as if he were sure he'd have time to deal with them in his next book (the torment of ex-POW Dave Luger and his interaction with a Ukrainian officer who had victimized him in a prior book is such an example).That said, Brown manages to repeat his typical mistakes - putting techno-jargon and other meaningless minutiae above the action, and disrupting the flow with more meaningless details. Brown can't so much as have a tilt-rotor MV-22 land (deep inside Russia to extract the spy) without going into an extended treatise on where its unit is based and who builds it, and providing a dossier about the crew. A Ukrainian Backfire bomber can't turn on its radar without triggering a volume of information on how the American pullout from Europe will leave Russia free reign over much of Europe. Brown will repeatedly refers to a character by his full name and title as if he wasn't sure he'd made them memorable enough when first introduced. (Colonel-General Smoliy of the Ukrainian Air Force is repeatedly referred to by that full title and his position). Many details are flat-out unnecessary - does a Dale Brown fan need to be told that F-16's are being launched with AIM-9 missiles and shells for their internal guns? Brown gets some good jibes in with his new President - a former war hero turned new-age hippy (he extols meditation). Brown's new pres manages a great twist in an outrageous bid to win freedom for American fliers captured during the botched spy-extraction, and he leaves enough room for readers to argue both sides on the subjec of the continued worldwide American military presence. The rest of the book doesn't live up to that promise. The Russians sneer, while our heroes' bureaucrat superiors rant about how the heroes aren't team players. The villain is just another overly-ambitious sleaze. There's plenty of action, but little coherent plot to stitch it on. There's a great action sequence involving the futile attempts to escape Russian airspace after the nearly ruined rescue, but it's hobbled. I don't care how experienced Brown is at military flight - his flight sequences are horrible - he barely establishes POV for his characters, frequently allows his characters to engage in full dialogue that doesn't hint to the stress of their high-performance flying and often merely summarizes what should be a heated and fleshed-out battle, but in Brown's flat prose, comes off as detailed and vivid as some late-1980's style flight simulator game. Although Brown pushes his reputation for ""realism"", he includes some exotic new stuff that makes his writing look as unrealistic as ever (electro-ray guns, cybernetic armor) and has yet to make the more real stuff (existing hardware like airplanes) seem realistic. Brown has got to realize that techno-thriller fans are more savvy than they were in 1987 and has got to do more than recycle the same plot over and over again."

The actual facts were evaluated in a court of law, and the accusations were proven false.

B0007J34GG,Journey through Britain,,A2UGG169K8C6SN,David Egan,3/4,5.0,1072224000,A sublime and invigorating walk,"From his writing, I imagine that John Hillaby would make the perfect walking companion. He is well spoken and straightforward, learned and curious. He has a gentle sensitivity for his surroundings and a taste for adventure, coupled the honesty to admit to fatigue, self-doubt, and crankiness. He has all the qualities that would intensify the pleasure of a walk while remaining erringly human, and humble enough to acknowledge the fact.His prose style carries a marvelous economy, where even passages that attain considerable lyricism read as unassuming reactions, the simplest means of conveying the extraordinary:&quot;Tremendous landslides have choked the floor of the glen with large, irregular blocks of rock that glint with mica. No trees. No grass. Only rocks sculptured by fire and ice. In places they are piled high, one above the other in chaotic architectural form as though, during a violent spasm, a cathedral had collapsed. This is Glen Dessary, a rift in the edge of Lochaber. Daysary the sheep-gatherers say, lingering on that last syllable of desolation, as though it betokened the end of the world. I never saw a wilder glen.&quot;Passages like this one are intermingled with down-to-earth narrative, digressions on regional dialects or pre-historic civilizations, and descriptions of the geological and biological landscape whose matter-of-factness belie Hillaby's well-studied and sensitive eye. The various elements are thrown together with a casual ease that gives the book a gentle rhythm, like a boat rocking on the swell: walk walk walk description walk walk digression walk walk moment-of-heartbreaking-beauty walk walk digression walk walk description walk walk walk. The rhythm is infectious, hypnotic. The book is so simple, and yet so beautiful, so hard to put down.Despite Hillaby's distinctive voice, he retains a sense of objectivity through humility. He passes his knowledge on to us as a casual guide, remarking on matters of interest as if he were commenting on the weather, and suggesting further reading like a friend pulling books off his shelf for our perusal. And yet, there is no pretense to omniscience: we sense that he is learning this stuff as he goes along, and that we could too, should we so choose.Likewise with the logistics of the hike itself. Things go wrong for Hillaby quite frequently, and while his misfortunes sometimes become a source of humor, he isn't ashamed to tell us that sometimes he is miserable, sometimes he doubts himself, sometimes he is tempted to accept the offer of a ride. But these confessions never take on the form of bravado: if anything, Hillaby understates the challenges he faces. There is no doubt that the hike is difficult, but he isn't so boastful as to complain about his hardship.Modern travel literature generally aims at simplicity, with the nave humor of misadventure jovially thrown in. Hillaby's account is one of the masterpieces of the genre, achieving sublime effects without a trace of pretension. He puts to shame the derring-do and studied humor of the Bill Brysons of travel literature, whose ego and forced bombast leaps out of every page. Hillaby doesn't force the excitement of his adventure on us but rather gently narrates, allowing us to discover the excitement for ourselves."

Although still working in radio, Rick's private investigator career has kicked off with his own organisation Rockin' Vestigations. With a new kitten that has severe sinus problems, Rick is ecstatic to have a new attractive client Lollie Woolfolk, who keeps throwing money his way to find out more and more about her long lost grandfather, his long ago associates and some legendary tapes known as the Blind, Crippled and Crazy Sessions. Rick's ecstation comes to an end after he works out he has been hired to track down victims for a murderer and receives a karate chop from the real Lollie Woolfolk which leaves him briefly unconscious and determined to bring the killer and fake Lollie to justice.Highway 61 resurfaced spent considerably less time than Radio Activity did with Rick in the studio or talking about classic rock albums which means an easier flowing storyline for this sequel which concentrates mostly on the PI side of things. It is by far the least surreal novel Fitzhugh has ever written and therefore the less humorous, but it still has a few surreal characters such as elderly blues players and a dim-witted drug taking killer to keep us entertained along with a funny occurrence between Rick and an ex client at a funeral. You don't need to have read Radio Activity to enjoy Highway 61 Resurfaced and not much of that storyline is given away if you read this novel first.

This series has to be considered one of the most predictable, monotonous, dry fantasy series out there. Near the beginning of every book David Eddings, for some reason I simply can't understand, basically spoils the rest of the book by having characters say what they're going to do. It's like ""We'll do A, then B, then C,"" where C is the end of the book. These summaries wouldn't be so detrimental if the author actually had some unexpected things happen along the way...but he doesn't. It happens exactly according to the summary every time. At least ninety percent of every book in the series is monotony--basically you know what's going to happen and are just waiting for it to take place.The characters are also pretty flat. They each of interesting quirks, but the author just keeps replaying them over and over again. If Aunt Pol makes one more smart-guy comment or Garion ""blushes"" in embarassment one more time... I tell you, someone blushing as much as him has no right to be a king of any sort.Now that the worst aspects of the series are out of the way...I must say I enjoyed the ""mythology"" inserted into the beginning of every book. In fact I enjoy that more than the book itself. It seems very creative, and it is very well done. Also the first book is probably 3 or 4 stars, rather than the rest of the series' 2 stars...the beginning of it is much better done.I have to conclude that life is too short to waste time on books like these. Just pass it on."

There was a great plot, too. I wasn't exactly sure how the novel was going to end, but I definitely didn't expect the actual ending. I felt that Woods could have done a much better job with the ending after having enjoyed the other parts of the book so much. Not that the ending was bad, it was just a little too far fetched and so much happened within like 15 pages. I do recommend the book, however, for the characters and the rest of the story."

So if you haven't read the first, you can start here.That Hideous Strength, unlike the first 2 books in this series, where Ransom leaves earth and fights evil in space and on other planets, the battle in this book takes place on earth.Ransom must lead a group of faithful believers against National Institute for Coordinated Experiments or N.I.C.E., an organization that believes that Science can solve all of humanity's problems. He must battle the people in this organization, super aliens trying to invade and control earth and use its population against other planets and against God.On top of all of that, Merlin has arisen from his long sleep and has arisen in England's time of greatest need. But the question is, who will find him first - N.I.C.E. or Ransom and his team? The fate of the world, and possibly the universe, rests on this question.Lewis called this story an adult's fairy-tale. It is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy, and a book that will keep your attention as you raptly turn the pages to find out where Lewis will lead you."
1901768945,Pride and Prejudice,,A8F2AZWB20X1H,JLind555,11/14,5.0,950140800,Of its time and for all time,"It is a truth not universally acknowledged, that ""Pride and Prejudice"" is probably not Jane Austen's best book. That honor is reserved for ""Mansfield Park"", a much deeper work. But it's almost everybody's favorite Austen, including mine, as much for the unforgettable characters as for the story.Elizabeth Bennet is the perfect heroine: she's bright, sharp, likeable, perceptive, nobody's fool, infinitely fallible, like all of us; but, unlike most of us, able to see and admit when she is in the wrong. Unlike her wacky mother and her shallow younger sisters, she does not see snaring a husband as her sole object in life, and thus she is supremely capable of putting Mr. Darcy in his place. Darcy's progression from an insufferable snob to an empathetic human being results from the realization that money and an old name are insufficient recommendations to a woman with real class, intelligence and character.Elizabeth's family is also well portrayed. We can understand why Elizabeth is her father's favorite child; he is as sharp and perceptive as she is, totally sensible and down to earth, a perfect foil for the ditzy Mrs. Bennet, who is so ridiculous you wish a chandelier would fall on her head, obsessed with marrying off her five eligible daughters. We know how the book is going to end almost as soon as it begins; Jane will hook Mr. Bingley in spite of the machinations of his nasty sisters, and Elizabeth, of course, will become Mrs. Darcy.""Pride and Prejudice"" is very much of it's time, set at the end of the 18th century, but it's been loved by generations of readers for the past two hundred years and looks good for at least another two hundred. It's quintessential Jane Austen.Judy Lind"
B000P1QRII,The Giver,,,,0/0,4.0,1022025600,The Giver Review,"""The Giver"" was an excellent book! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I couldn't put it down! It was like I was addicted to it!I was always reading!The book taught me a lot about how we live. It taught me about how important love, pain and especially feelings are. Withoutthese things, we wouldn't be the people we are today. We need feelings to shape us into the people we are going to be. If you gothrough life without people loving you and sharing good and badtimes with you, your life is basically incomplete!Some people like teachers and parents, think that other kids shouldn't read this book because it sets bad examples and deals with serious, mature issues. One thing in the book that they might think is not appropriate is when the young girl injects a needle into her skin to kill herself. People think that this book shows that it is okay to end things when times get tough. They are wrong because the people in the book don't know what they are doing. They don't know death is.Overall, this is an exceptional book. I would have to say it is very rare that kids are interested in books they read in school and out, so I know this has to be a good book. This is a must-read book!Written By:Jordan Hobbs"

Have or develop an understandable charter.2. Communicate and co-ordinate effectively.3. Establish clear roles and responsibilities.4. Create time-efficient processes.5. Develop a sense of accountability.Clear distinction between when a single leader 'discipline' is warranted or when a real team discipline is warranted.Great re-cap about establishing clear outcomes.Once the background is set-up, it becomes an issue of delving deeper into the application of their recommendations. It is great stuff! But you'll have to buy the book to 'get it'!They do a good job in dissecting how virtual teams are different and similar to teams with co-located members.Finally, I really like their road to getting a team 'unstuck'. Their observation that teams that become stuck revert to single-leader leadership is absolutely true. They posit that it's necessary for a good team to become stuck. As pain as it might be, you have a great opportunity to:- clarify goals- identify missing skills- address attitude issues- grapple with changing members- address time pressures- work on lack of disciplineThe chapter on change is pretty decent, the rest of the content is golden.I've rated this five stars as it's a must for anyone who works with teams.Damien Faughnan"
B0007F1GKQ,"Omoo: A narrative of adventures in the South Seas (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)",,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,"H. Schneider ""Hermit""",21/25,4.0,1213660800,Not quite a portrait of the artist as a young man,"I am approaching the writer Melville with little prior knowledge about the man Melville. Apart from the Whale, read 30 years ago, I knew only Typee before taking up Omoo. Omoo is of course a sequel to Typee. While Typee's core theme is the narrator's life in captivity among an intact tribe of 'savages' in the Marquesas, Omoo continues his adventures as an island hopper, a sailor involved in a mutiny, a jailbird, a farm worker...All is told with a light hand, in short chapters. Interspersed are thoughts about colonialism and missionaries and about the fate of the native population of the islands. There is lots of ethnology on mainly two exotic tribes: the population of the whaling ships, and the people who live on Tahiti. The attacks on the missionaries seem to have been toned down a bit in view of criticisms at home. The sequel was less well received than the first book.What strikes me as curious about Omoo is the extent to which the author hides behind a mocking and sometimes self-ironic tone. He is not much given to reflections about himself, or at least not to sharing those with us. What do we conclude about the character of the hero? Obviously he has some problems integrating in his various social environments. He is always the outsider. He runs from his first ship, is an exotic guest in Typee, runs away, joins half-heartedly in a mutiny on his second ship, stays apart from the jail crowd and 'walks away' from prison, doesn't like the work on the potato farm, escapes from some unclear danger in the next village... Would one extrapolate so far, does it seem likely that he will succeed in settling down to any longer term project? He seems unsteady and shallow, aloof without much depth to offer. The story itself is fairly simple, the author does not appear to have a message above the adventure narration and a few rather superficial thoughts on the evils of civilization. In other words, one hopes he will grow up some time. Let's see."

Where any abundance of joy and hope is dashed first, then exposed, if lucky.Boy and Girl are newly-weds, and she is pregnant opening the story. Girl gives birth, and as casually as that they are parents. Man and Woman are here too. Expounding on the oddities and ironies of life, they cease any theatrical construct and refer to the audience at will, inviting us in to what becomes and experiment, or an exorcism.Like Nick and Honey in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Boy and Girl are taken on a ride by Man and Woman, brought into the open, exposed and scarred (""Wounds, children, wounds. Learn from it. Without wounds, what are you? If you don't have a broken heart...""), to perhaps be made even more whole, as they are forced to shed their skin of simple beauty, joy and love.If the ""whole thing"" is really about the ""baby,"" meaning survival and procreation, the simple yet vital act we are obsessed with, in order to keep going is here eviscerated. The commercial love and joy of parenthood picked on and torn, the easy-in-easy-out given as shallow, and the true rites of passage amidst life are shown to be the knowledge of damage, hurt, abandonment, falsity, lies.Brilliant Albee."

Scout and her brother, Jem, learn valuable lessons about life from the colorful characters around them and a society fraught with hard economic times and racial tension. Set during the depression in rural Alabama, Scout leads us through her world with the innocent eyes of a child. Not always understanding, but ever seeing.When Scout's father Atticus Finch is chosen to represent an African American man accused of raping a white woman, the stage is set for these children to learn some very valuable lessons about life...and the greatness of their father's integrity. When things are rough and the family may lose its innocence, a most unlikely hero steps from the shadows to save our young heroine and her brother in their time of need.To Kill a Mockingbird may be a classic for many reasons, but it will remain in this reader's heart for its character, its integrity and its willingness to step outside of the societal norm and see the goodness in people regardless of what the world at large may think or be told to believe. You would be hard pressed to find a classic book more easily entertaining and heart warming as this one.If you are not a reader, I highly recommend watching the 1962 movie of the same title, with Gregory Peck starring as Atticus Finch. If it is possible for an actor to capture the spirit of a character and bring that character more readily to life, I have not seen it yet.Enjoy!To Kill a Mockingbird"

Like Dachshunds are good at keeping goblins away and fairies use nuts to keep in contact.

This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles.

We would watch the movie adaptation of this incredible book, and I would find myself liking it more and more as I watched it.I remember renting this book from my local public library when I was in high school, and I read it day and night. I took it to school, and even skipped a day of school just to read the last bit of it.I purchased this book again, just this year, right before a convention called C2E2 came along. I wanted to purchase the book for a long time, but when I finally read on C2E2's website that Anne Rice was going to be a guest at the convention... You could not imagine my joy. She seemed very happy to see all of her fans and even hosted a panel with another gentleman. I honestly could not stay for long, because I was too excited that I found myself running down stairs. This was of course to start standing in line to make the autograph session. To no surprise, I found myself at the end of quite a long line. I did not care. I could not wait to meet the author. When I finally did, I was completely starstruck. We had only exchanged a few words like ""Hi. How are you?"" ""Good, and you?"" and I found myself on my way to hang out with some of my friends again.As I've said, I basically grew up with this series of books... More importantly, I grew up with 'Interview with the Vampire' and 'The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)'.I love Anne Rice's writing style. Every time I read the books in this series, I cannot put them down without picking them back up, not even for a moment. I like that the writer does this. She really grabs the attention of her readers, especially ones that have been vampire fans for what seems to have been centuries.I've read every vampire novel worth reading, and this series IS the best of them all.

This book was written in 1959 and is NOTHING like the movie. For me, it is one of the best novels that I have ever read in any genre. Starship Troopers tells the tale of a young man who decides to join earth's marine fighting force against a variety of alien enemies. However, the book spends little time actually in action scenes describing the various conflicts. Much of the book is all about the boot-camp of the future, the rigorous training that the men go through and the psychological state of not just the recruits but also of their commanders. This is a beautiful book, rooted in the American military traditions of World War II. It exudes the concepts of honor and courage in a poetic, easy-to-read manner. It discusses military and societal theory in such a way that the reader does not get bored, and much of the political commentary is interesting and insightful. The book is sophisticated in its critiques of modern society and of its view of the military and its place in society. It truly is infinitely more than the movie made it out to be. Heinlein has written a masterpiece that can live through the ages. Definately an great and entertaining read and a must for any sci-fi fan or military history buff. Check it out, and enjoy!"

But this is a top 10 must!","Despite the fact this book is being trashed by a few outspoken ""poor dads"" is not only to be expected, it is just a bit humorous. Why would a book about improving yourself make some people so mad? Either the book or Kiyosaki himself are called overly simplistic, inaccuate, or even disingenuous. But when the sour grapes are put aside and the book is taken on its own merits, it deserves a high rating for getting its point across. If you're broke and looking for a way to change your stars, ignore the naysayers, put this book on a top 10 list, and get to reading. If it encourages you to take even one step in a positive direction, it will have done its job.This book is about choosing to model financially successful people (whether your own parents or someone else's). ""Poor dad"" and ""rich dad"" are presented as two different men with two different approaches to money, wealth, and career, both of whom are advising a young man as he grows up. The book is typified by the story of ""poor dad"" who encourages his son to climb the corporate ladder; ""rich dad"" responds, ""I'd rather own the ladder.""The central message of the book is also simple: ""The idea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people. . . Money is only an idea. If you want more money simply change your thinking."" This is not rocket science; it is a matter of some basic information and of self-control.The book talks a lot about real estate, because that is Kiyosaki's background. But the book isn't about real estate; it's about learning to think about money in a different way and about adjusting your approach to meet your own goals.Lessons learned from rich dad include the following basic points: Don't work for money, make money work for you; become literate about finances; take care of your business; learn how taxes work for corporations, then adopt that for yourself; learn how to invent money, like the rich; and work to learn, don't work for money. Each of these concepts is duscussed and illustrated in interesting ways. Against those who object that this is all ""common sense,"" it is NOT common sense to people who don't know it! And, after all, the book was written for those readers, not for people who already know everything.Learning how to overcome obstacles is central to success: ""The main reason most people are not rich is becase they are terrified of losing. Winners are not afaid of losing. But losers are. Failure is part of the process of success. People who avoid failure also avoid success."" The critics are (naturally) yelping ""Hype!"" at statements like this. Just ignore these ""poor dads"" who can't stand other people's success, and who want to interfere with yours, and soak up all you can from this book before going to the next.The book is full of enthusiastic encouragement, but it is more than hype: it's an entry to a new way of thinking about yourself and money. There are helpful diagrams, tips, stories, and directions.To get started, Kiyosaki urges readers to (1) focus on your heart's desire; (2) make wise choices; (3) be picky about the company you keep (e.g., ""Don't listen to poor or frightened people""); (4) learn fast, and then keep learning while you adapt; (5) Pay yourself first (""I would venture to say that it is the lack of personal self discipline that is the No. 1 delineating factor between the rich, poor and the middle class""); (6) pay your brokers well (i.e., don't be chincy with the people who bring you to the dance); (7) focus on ROI (return on investment), and learn to ask, ""How fast do I get my money back?""; (8) use assets to buy luxuries (stop burning a hole in your pocket to get the things you want); (9) have heros (role-models -- they make things look easy, but they show you the path); and (10) learn the power and importance of giving back.Again, it is no secret that Kiyosaki has been attacked as a fraud in numerous forums. I do not know the man, but I appreciate the book enormously and recommend it highly to anyone struggling to improve your life. Despite certain negative claims, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is not anti-education, does not encourage people to be stupid in making career or financial decisions, and is not unsound in its advice. It presents itself as an ""attitude adjustment"" about money, and that is just what it is.Rich Dad, Poor Dad is not perfect or the only book you should read on this subject. But it is helpful, encouraging, inspirational, informational, and worth a top 10 spot for those looking to improve your financial life. Ignore the ""poor dads"" and read the book.By the way, one thing rarely mentioned about this book: the Co-Author of this book is Sharon Lechter, a successful CPA in her own right. Her 10 page introduction is well worth reading."

B000GLP2NI,The Clocks,,A3I9PUR2E3BSJC,"Ruth Anderson ""Book Reviewer""",0/0,3.0,1310860800,"Red herrings, misdirection, and a side of Poirot...","When Sheila Webb, a typist-for-hire, is particularly requested for her latest assignment, she expects a routine hour of work, not the discovery of a recently murdered elderly man behind the sitting room sofa, surrounded by clocks set to the wrong time. Horrified, she flees from the scene and straight into the arms of intelligence agent Colin Lamb, pursuing his own line of investigation, on the tail of a nest of spies. The victim has no identification on him, and both Sheila and her would-be-employer, a Miss Pebmarsh, claim to have no knowledge of the victim's identity. Even stranger, Miss Pebmarsh claims to never requested a typist's services. Colin feels an immediate kinship with Sheila, and determines to see the investigation through and the lovely stenographer cleared of all suspicion. But as the investigation progresses, and lead after lead fails to reveal motive or the victim's identity, Colin turns to his old friend Hercule Poirot for help in unraveling the tangled web of murder, lies, and deceit that have taken up residence in the seemingly genteel neighborhood of Wilbraham Crescent...The Clocks is one of Christie's later Poirot novels, and I feel like it shows. Most obviously, Poirot barely appears in the novel, and the need for his investigative acumen feels a little forced as opposed to an organic part of the storyline. I also found the narrative style a bit cumbersome. Christie alternates between third-person narration and first-person narration, from Colin's point-of-view, and with the exception of the prologue, I would've preferred to read the entire novel from Colin's perspective. In many respects Colin is a classic Christie hero, a bright young thing, burdened with questions about the nature of his profession. Whether from his viewpoint or third-person, experiencing the entire story in one narrative style would have, I believe, tightened the narrative flow and raised the suspense factor.In this adventure Christie employs an interesting mix of international espionage and neighborhood dynamics. The latter is more effective than the former, as Christie was a master at misdirection and an adept at slyly suggesting danger or subterfuge in that most genteel of locations - the proper English village or neighborhood. I particularly enjoyed the scenes where Colin and Inspector Hardcastle attempted to glean clues about the murdered man from the odd assortment of neighbors surrounding Miss Pebmarsh's home. I wish Poirot had been given more ""screentime,"" if you will, but I enjoyed the detective's lengthy discussion of contemporary crime fiction (including Christie creation Ariadne Oliver) and its reliance on coincidence and chance. In a novel perhaps over-populated with red herrings, Poirot's commentary is perhaps Christie's own sly comment on the conventions of a genre she largely helped define in the twentieth century. Ultimately while not one of my favorite Poirot novels, The Clocks benefits from a strong, unique opening while providing a showcase for Christie's trademark red herrings and carefully constructed, twisting plotlines."

I reread Heart of Darkness because my ""guys"" reading group included two who had not ever read it. The story stands up far, far better than I would have guessed. Conrad is really superb, and this shortish novel could well persuade new readers that ""literary"" stuff is worth their while. I had forgotten how subtle, how grown-up Conrad's expectations of his reader are. Truly quite marvelous.With trepidation, I splurged on the Norton edition, even though I am pretty hostile to English-Professor post-modern posturing and nonsense. I am glad I got it, however. The wealth of historical documents help make the then-contemporary setting come real. The big surprise for me was Chinua Achebe's fine essay. While ""bloody racist"" is still over the top, Achebe has a case of some importance, and argues it well. It is even a comfort to find that the knee-jerk responses by assorted literature professors are indeed just as much postie poo as I had expected. (It's always a pleasure to find that one's unexamined prejudices are warranted after all.)A particular pleasure for me was talking about the book with my daughter, who has taught it to her honors high school English class. She has developed views, and I learned really quite a lot from listening to her.

B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,A6SPP93H6CS4F,J Brian Pierce,0/0,5.0,931737600,Cold Mountain shall take its place among classic literature.,"Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Cold Mountain is that it is Charles Frazier's first novel. Before I had even neared the middle of the book, I began to compare it to classics such as Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, for Cold Mountain contains within all the elements that allow a work to persevere through the ages. The depth of intellect and insight combined with superb weaving of a complex plot create a text rich in detail and imagery. Frazier has an incredibly mature and well-developed writing style that afforded the story a dignity no longer seen in modern literature; an element I feel that has been tragically lost. Frazier's development of character and plot appear to be almost divinely inspired, for it does not bow to worldly expectations but ventures forth to create a mold all its own. Some feel that Frazier chose an illogical path in the closing of his narrative, yet I argue that Frazier remained true to the bold nature of truth and did not allow his work to degrade into a simple fairy-tale. To expect such an ending to a work as deep and moving as this one is to allow society's demand to ignore the harshness of reality to overtake one's soul. I strongly recommend one add this work to one's reading list as it will appear many years from now among authors such as Shakespeare, Twain, and Dickens."

There is also the detective/police case Anita is invovled with, but this time Anita is a Federal Marshall, though it felt like it wasn't as prominent, but what was prominent was Dolph's out-of-character scenes.

When I consulted my teacher about whether I should choose Faulkner or another author to read, she told me something along the lines of, &quot;Faulkner's regionalistic and enigmatic style is interpreted two different ways by two different types of people: One think that he is symbolic and profound, the other think that he is not and rather full of it.&quot; Well, I do feel sorry for the 'other' group, because to not reconize the depth behind his more-poetic-than-most-poets words is just plain out wacky. I will say that he is not your typical fiction writer, his books do not have action oriented plots (or even any action in some cases), but he still somehow manages to catch your interest. I have never fell asleep while reading a book or story by Faulkner, and not many authors have earned this distinction. He also leaves you with a sense of reflection, again something distinguishing him from many others. Personally, I prefer short stories to novels, I find that my focus to the point and plot of the story is less distracted by the end as with a novel and I typically find that I retain more. I do enjoy Faulkner's novels and have read quite a few, but this collection of short stories is just brilliant beyond brilliant. His words are potent and sharp in all of them, even if his point and meaning is more elusive. I completely and totally recommend that everyone read this collection of stories. Everyone. Really.

B000OXK7PG,My Life,,AGKWREMYAJ1YM,Abu Amaal,14/24,5.0,1091318400,"His life, so far","The most thoughtful review I've come across for this book so faris Hendrik Hertzberg's extended essay in the New Yorker, available on-line at the New Yorker site.This is a long and detailed book, which, as Clinton acknowledges, would have been twice as long without his editor's help. It certainly gives a clear impression of his general approach and way of viewing the world. Clinton is a very intelligent man with a broad range of interests, who revels in dealing with the details of policy issues. He is aware that this creates a problem of focus. I once suggested to a colleague of mine that he was spreading himself a bit thin, and he replied by giving me a list of his various activities on one page, and asking what exactly I would cut out. Clinton gives much the same response - everything he dealt with was, in his view, too important to ignore.What we have here could easily have been five different books, one dealing with his childhood, one with general political philosophy, and so on. In fact there are entire books, and interesting ones, dealing with matters he covers in a page, such as the Dayton accords.Clinton is a strong believer in centrist politics, accenting the positive and avoiding sharp attacks. This has worked relatively well for him, though as he acknowledges has given some of his adversaries the impression that he is a soft target. It is not a strategy that can easily be adopted by others; one gets the impression that it is easier to adopt the tone than the substance of his approach.In any case, it is undeniably interesting to see the business of running the country (and dealing with a wide range of international issues) from the point of view of the man then in charge, particularly as he actually understood the issues and did not simply rely on his subordinates for direction. He acknowledges a number of mistakes, both political and technical.The book would be better if it covered about half as much, in slightly greater detail.The very long initial section on his early life is probably worth having, as it helps one understand not only what his political philosophy is, but how it came to be that way. No doubt it could have been cut back considerably with no substantial loss, or indeed published as an independent volume for those who are more interested in the personal side of things.Equally to the point, his early political experiences in national politics, such as the McGovern campaign, help explain what one might call his &quot;extreme centrism&quot;, whose basis he articulates rather well.The other day I heard a rumor that Clinton has set his sights on the Secretary Generalship of the United Nations.An interesting thought.At the moment there are a number of interesting political books around dealing with the issues of the day: &quot;Against All Enemies&quot;,&quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot;, and a whole raft of others (as well as more polemical texts). In the short term, these are more immediately informative than Clinton's text, and more concise, but I would add Clinton's biography to the list as well worth reading. And among older books, I think Holbrooke's &quot;To End a War&quot; is exceptionally interesting, and more interesting than Clinton's biography. To my taste, a detailed look at a well-defined subject tends to offer more than a very broad survey, though both have their place. One will not learn much about the sordid (from any point of view) Starr affair from Clinton's book; he refers for more detail to the considerably more revealing (and much angrier) book by Joe Conason, &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot;, which is indeed quite interesting within its limited terrain."

B000MS5P3M,The Sand Pebbles,,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,Roger J. Buffington,31/33,5.0,1086739200,America present at China's emergence as a nation.,"&quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is an interesting and entertaining novel set in China circa 1925. China is governed by feuding warlords, and its foreign trade is dominated by foreign &quot;treaty powers&quot; including the USA, Japan, and the leading European nations, all of which maintain strong naval and marine forces in China to maintain their positions and protect foreign persons and property.The novel takes place on an obsolete, barely functioning American river gunboat, the &quot;San Pablo,&quot; known to her crew as the &quot;Sand Pebble.&quot; The protagonist, Jake Holman, is an engineer-crewman aboard the Sand Pebble. Jake has a passion for mastering the ship's engines, but initially is frustrated by the fact that aboard the Sand Pebble each American sailor has a Chinese coolie understudy who in fact does almost all of the work aboard ship. The Sand Pebble crewmen have delegated almost all of the ship's routine to a shadow crew of Chinese coolies, and do very little actual work. Jake's frustration with the coolie-understudy system and his attempt to fit in with the Sand Pebble crew are part of the main theme of the novel.The real story of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is, however, the emergence of China as a modern nation. The Kuomantang Chinese Nationalist movement is becoming ascendant in China as the novel unfolds, and it seeks to sweep away foreign influence, and the warlord system that has kept China weak and divided. The officers and crew of the &quot;Sand Pebble,&quot; in common with the other foreign military forces, must deal with this new movement, which seeks to change Old China, which had seemed eternally unchangeable. The slow understanding by the foreigners, including the Sand Pebble, that this change is real and something that must be dealt with, is the real story in the novel.Author McKenna does a masterful job of presenting China as it was in the 1920s, together with life in the American gunboat navy of those times. This is a novel rich with detail and atmosphere. Both the American and Chinese protagonists are presented with dignity and insight, making this a very interesting read. While the storyline of crewman Holman is interesting enough, this is only an excuse to tell the real story--the transformation of China.This novel will reward the patient reader. I personally found it engrossing and entertaining. Recommended."

For Steinbeck to find this essential truth buried in one of the oldest and most commonly known stories in the western world is remarkable.

Two wandering ranch hands keep the gleam of hope alive, as they privately dream of someday owning a small ranch, where they can be their own boss and live off the fat of the land. Freedom and roots--is that too much to ask of life? But Steinbeck readers will not be surprised at his pessimistic view of the human condition.George and Lennie travel everywhere together, working and sharing the visicitudes of 1930's migrant life--lucky to have a meager supper of canned beans without ketchup. But these two men, who are not even related, are bound as deeply as brothers. George, the short guy with the brains, feels responsible for his big, simple-minded companion, who depends on him for work, food and dreams of a better future. Lennie is a gentle retarded man, who panics easily--not realizing his own tremendous physical strength.This story is more than a mere '30s novella, for it pits the private vulnerability of human nature against pitiless fate. The story, 75% dialogue with only 25% narrative, reads easily, flowing along like the indifferent Salinas River, which inexorably carries its characters to a tragic denoument.

B00088AOXC,"Herodotus, (Bohn's classical library)",,A1ST408CHP050B,Eustathios,0/0,5.0,1359936000,Michael A. Flower's and John Marincola's commentary on Herodotus Book IX,"This is a review of Michael A. Flower's and John Marincola's commentary on Book IX of Herodotus's Histories for the Cambridge green and yellow series. Book IX is the final book of Herodotus's Histories and contains, among other things, Herodotus's accounts of the Battles of Plataea and Mycale, the immediate aftermath of the Persians' defeat in and withdrawal from mainland Greece, and the Siege of Sestos. F&M; are particularly interested in showing how Book IX achieves closure for the Histories as a whole and how it prefigures the political-cultural landscape of the mid-late fifth century BC, when Herodotus was writing, so a reader interested in Herodotus's aspirations/agenda as a historian and author and how Herodotus's narrative anticipates later (particularly Athenian) historical developments will find this commentary particularly enlightening.This edition consists of a 50 page introduction, 50 pages of Greek text, about 215 pages of commentary, four brief appendices occupying 11 pages, a very comprehensive bibliography of almost 20 pages (current through 2002), and two indexes (one for Greek terms, and one for general topics). The authors provide enough grammatical and lexical help that a student in his or her third or fourth year of studying Greek should be able to read Book IX with little difficulty using the commentary, and the majority of the notes in fact are primarily designed to help with translation. However, the discussions of literary and historical issues are fairly complex and clearly pitched to an advanced audience, so this edition is probably not suitable for a student reading Greek prose for the first time (Amy Barbour's textbook ""Selections from Herodotus"" is a better option in this respect). Unlike many modern commentaries on the works of ancient historians, the treatment of historiographic problems is balanced quite well with discussions of the literary qualities of Herodotus's text. Delineating Herodotus's appropriation of Homeric language and ideology, for example, is accorded just as much importance as evaluating the historical accuracy of Herodotus's narrative. Readers who are interested in Herodotus from either a literary critical angle or from a historical angle will therefore both find useful material in this commentary.There are number of other features of this edition that are worthy of note. The introduction - in addition to containing the usual accounts of Herodotus's life and times, an overview of his style and techniques as an author/historian, a very brief reckoning of the manuscripts, and an analysis of the major themes, characters, and events of Book IX - also includes a concise guide to Herodotus's Ionic dialect, giving readers who are only familiar with Attic prose a handy aid for identifying and understanding Ionic forms. The four appendices provide Greek texts of and commentary on primary sources that complement the narrative of Book IX (i.e. Simonides' poem on Plataea, the putative dedication of the seer Teisamenus, and the so-called 'Oath of Plataea') as well as a list of the troops composing the Greek and Persian battle lines at Plataea.It is not possible in a short review to enumerate all the different questions and issues F&M; cover in their notes, but I will say that their commentary is one of the most wide-ranging, erudite, and thought-provoking that I have encountered in this or any other series of commentaries on ancient texts. It is one of the few commentaries on the market that attempts to address ALL aspects of a text in detail while still prioritizing providing grammatical help to the student-reader, and on the whole it succeeds remarkably well in doing so. Moreover, the commentary is composed in a very straight-forward and engaging style and is often quite entertaining. For example, as part of a note on Herodotus's account of the seer Hegesistratus, who had to escape a Spartan prison by mutilating his foot so that he could wrest it free from the chain that bound it, F&M; remark (pg.177) with perfect aplomb: ""Two physicians have confirmed for us that Hegesistratus could have survived and not bled to death before reaching Tegea"".In short, then, this commentary combines magisterial learning with judicious organization and presentation, and should definitely be read by anyone with a few years of Greek and a serious interest in Herodotus and Greek History."

HehnA Low Dishonest Decade is an account of German economic and financial policy and its design upon the diplomatic and political relations that inexorably leads to World War II.In reading this book, it is assumed the reader has a fairly sophisticated knowledge of pre-war German trade policy, economics, finance, natural resources and the foreign policy positions of both Europe and the United States. Written in chronological format with business style statistics, the author outlines German Third Reich foreign policy actions in direct historical context to the economic and natural resource issues of the pre-war period. And unlike some written accounts of the Third Reich that chronicle revisionist history and unsubstantiated arguments, A Low Dishonest Decade combines economics, strategy and historical events into a very readable documentary. The reader is continually reminded of the precarious financial and natural resource situation facing Germany and this almost desperate and imperative situation advancing Germany's strategic aims prior to the outbreak of military aggression in 1939. Also included is a survey of European countries, diplomatic agreements and the crucial decisions by leaders in world commodity markets as proactive and reactive agents to the realties facing Germany and its future. Along the 405 pages are photos from the Getty archives of important policy leaders, a boundary line map of Hungary from the Library of Congress, and a glossary of key names and diplomatic agreements, the later of which appears to be missing.Although the primary focus of this book is on markets, economics and finance also included in the typeface is a limited strategy of the German military forces and the political ""Mein Kampf"" Liebenstraum ideology affecting this transitional period of economic initiative to offensive warfare.Sean Marche"

I would have them rebuild it as it was but stronger and taller. Sadly, that's not going to happen and in a way, the terrorists have won. The new Freedom Tower which hasn't broken ground yet is bombarded by the red tape and not terroristic threats.The three authors of this book, John Miller, Michael Stone, and Chris Mitchell have written a powerful, brilliant book about the events that lead to September 11, 2001 where almost 3,000 humans perished in acts of terrorism including John O'Neill, a former agent to the FBI, who was on his second day at his new job, Director of Security for the World Trade Center. He perished alongside others who never heard of Bin Laden or Al Quaeda. Now we all, Osama Bin Laden and his army of terrorists were working on attacking the United States. We asked why?This book describes events such as the bombings of the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. One US Ambassador wrote a letter of concern regarding the embassy's safety in Nairobi to then Secretary of State Madeline Albright. She asked after the bombing ""How could this have happened?"" The US Ambassador wounded but survived replied ""I wrote you a letter.America's intelligence failures in preventing and stopping the events of September 11, 2001 now becomes how do our government agencies improve to prevent another catastrophe of biblical proportions of happening again. The FBI and CIA were not working together but paralleled each other. They should have been working together all along on terrorism.There are surprising heroes and heroines like Monica Rowley who blew the whistle on FBI operations in Minneapolis that resulted in the arrest of one of the terrorists. Surprisingly only a month before, American actor James Woods was on flight from Boston to San Francisco with the four terrorists from September 11. Because he is an actor, he studies human behavior for his art. He made a comment that he believed they would hijack the plane and told the pilot after they landed safely.Three thousand human lives were lost and others too in the war against the United States from Osama Bin Laden and his supporters. I am sure that if the American intelligence agencies have learned any lesson--it is that they have to work together and not at each other.Eight years later, the events are still fresh in my mind. I used to see the World Trade Center, those marvelous twin Towers that spruced up the New York City skyline, and I traveled to and from New York City in 1997 from my hometown in New Jersey. On a clear day here, I used to see the twin towers. I'm lucky if I see the Empire State Building thirty miles south.I wished the events of September 11, 2001 had never happened. This book helps me understand that it didn't happen over night but was planned and warning signs were missed by those in power. This should never happen again."

I didn't think it was necessarily a BAD book, simply that i didn't see any real point to it. 'Why would anyone write a book like this?' i thought to myself. 'I mean this M. Meursault is just a comnpletely self-centered loser, indifferent to life itself.' By the last chapter, however, when he is thinking over his ever-looming beheadment, the writing and descriptions of the concept of life and death to an ordinary person with no real biases whatsoever, was so thought-proking and beautiful that i could've cried. After finishing it, however, i was still a little confused as to what the point was. About 3 days later, i was still thinking about it, mulling each chapter over in my head--a definite sign of a good book. (After all, even if one can read a book, give it a shallow label of &quot;good&quot;, but never thinks about it again or probes it for meaning, how good was it?) Finally, (I think) I came to a conclusion: M. Meursault's thoughts as he was awaiting his execution finally resulted in a basic gist of &quot;well, we all gotta die sometime, so really, no big deal.&quot; I think the contrasting, implied meaning that Camus was trying to bring out was, &quot;yeah, we all gotta die sometime, THUS, it's not death--how it's carried out, or when it occurs--that's important, but rather, what you do on this earth in LIFE.&quot; I believe M. Meursault's last remark, &quot;For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration&quot;, summed that very idea up well, indeed. It sort of leaves one (or at least ME) with an impression that M. Meursault has one last resolve to make something memorable and extraordinary out of his life, if it be only his execution; one last attempt at trying to live out the life he remained passive and indifferent toward during his time on earth"

Some of the examples of the evidence presented here is given below.She notes a large outcry by planters in Trinidad in 1823 when the whipping of female slaves was banned. The planters argued that it was the only effective device for specifically keeping female slaves in line. ""One colonial office official stated that female slaves 'more frequently merited punishment than males.'""She quotes accounts from several planters about the particular insolence of domestic female slaves. Such domestics were often in a worse position than fieldhands for they were under much closer scrutiny of masters and vulnerable to the latter's sexual lecheries and subsequent raging jealousies of the master's wife. Even with benevolent masters as lovers, the slave women would manipulate and steal from them. Such manipulation and stealing by all slaves was seen as evidence of being inherent traits among Africans by people too stupid to comprehend that the slaves might be asserting their own individuality and freedom by this act.She quotes an account from testimony before the House of Commons in 1790 by one Henry Coor who reported that the owner of a Jamaican plantation where he stayed one night nailed the ear of a domestic slave to a tree post because she had broken a plate. The slave in the morning was found to have wrenched her ear out of this imprisonment and when found was severely whipped. She quotes an account from a Dr. John Williamson who related the story of a slave giving birth after having been confined in the stocks and then dying of a fever.She quotes accounts from estates owned by two London merchants, Thomas and William King. In one estate she quotes a punishment book that of the 34 slaves punished in the first six months of 1827, 21 were women. She quotes a number of accounts of individual insubordination on an estate of the Kings in what is now Guiana in South America. Even though a slave named Clarrissa had her punishment increased from 12 hours of solitary confinement to 60 hours chained in the stockade, her insubordination did not decrease, writes the author.She quotes accounts from a liberal planter named Monk Lewis who reported a scene of insubordination at his place where female slaves affected a work slowdown. When an overseer demanded that the women do their duty, one of the latter ran at the former and tried to strangle him. Lewis is quoted on reports of white overseers kicking pregnant black women in their bellies and thereby damaging the child or the mother.Slave-owners began to enact legislation for their own benefit to ameliorate the harsh treatment of black women, for with slave importation being banned, they were concerned about slave labor not destroying the fertility of women. They also were under pressure from abolitionists. Black women generally received solitary confinement or being chained up in the stocks as opposed to the whippings still delivered on black men. Though the whip on women was still being used. The author quotes an account from a plantation in Grenada in 1823 of a female slave being whipped and again apparently another female being whipped ten years later for destroying sugar canes and ""general neglect of duty."" She quotes an account from this time of female slave at the plantation of Mrs. Carrie Carmicheal who colored her tongue a different color each check-up to make it seem like she was ill but then her tongue was whipe cleaned to reveal that she had been faking illness to avoid work and she was thus flogged.She gives accounts of slave women being involved in many rebellions. There is the Jamaican maroon leader Nanny in the 1730's and ""Cubah,"" leader of the slave revolt in Jamaica in 1760. She quotes an account from a rebellion in Surinam in 1730 where 8 of the 11 executed for it were women. Six of the females were ""broken alive on the rack"" and the other two, youngsters, were decapitated but they had such nerve in facing these atrocities that they ""did not utter a sigh."" She quotes an account from a male slave under interrogation that the only major uprising on Barbados, which took place in 1816, was formented by a woman She states that from contemporary accounts, women played a big role in the mob actions to protest poor working conditions in St. Kitts in 1834 druing the brief ""apprenticeship."" She ""transition"" to emancipation. There were two women in the group of sixteen sentenced for sedition and mutiny in this incident. She quotes an account from an English official during the great uprising of 20,000 slaves in Jamaica in 1831 that women were heavily involved as guides for rebels, as provocateurs to try to cause harm to British forces, and so on.She gives accounts of how black women were feared because of their knowledge of Obeah herbal formulas that could poison whites and their leadership in African religious ceremonies which could be occasions for plotting rebellion.She talks alot about the sexual mores of slave women. The planters propagated the notion that black women were inherently inclined towards promiscuity. Contemporary abolitionists agreed that slave women were promiscuous, only arguing that the degradation of slavery made them that way. She goes through an analysis of West African and slave sexual and marriage customs. Many African socities seem to have had a custom of ""trial marriage"" and divorce was relatively easy to obtain. In marooon communities, according to the author, young women were accorded something like ""coming out"" parties perhaps similar to those for aristocratic girls in Europe. The author quotes a Barbados parliament report to the House of Commons in 1789 that the black women there were very gentle and virtous. She quotes a Jamaican slave doctor who estimated that black men were no more promiscuous then men in England.....The author concludes that most slave families were monogamous, with strong retention of African extended family structures despite the threat of enforced separation through sales. Polygamy was rather minor and according to accounts, the first wives in such relationships obtained almost equal status with the husbands. She quotes slave-owners accounts of the generous and happy relations among slaves.She explores the evidence that the low fertility rate among slaves in the West Indies was due to black women killing their babies within nine days after birth or willing their own miscarriage.The book gets exceedingly slow to read towards the end....."

It's hard...",3/4,5.0,1297296000,"The Digital Future Frontier, from the Inventor of Cyberspace","I came to this book via theTime magazinelist of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923. I'd heard the title a few times, always positive comments on the book, but never really thought about picking it up. I bought a number of others from the Time list, and I'm working my way through the pile.Yes, I'll cop to it; I'm a nerd, always have been. But having read my share ofAsimov,Heinlein,DickandHerbert, I've never really been that into sci-fi. In fact, this is my first sci-fi novel in very many years.That being said, in many ways this isn't really a sci-fi novel, at least that's how I see it. It's a cool, hot, pounding story of a near-future, told with great attention to detail.The hardest part of ingesting this book is remembering that it was written in 1984. As such, it is a visionary masterpiece, laying out 20 years ago where we were headed as a digital society, and in very many ways, exactly where we have ended up and where we likely are going.Just a few pages inJohnny Mnemoniccame instantly to mind, and I found out only by checking the next day that this was a Gibson original--go figure.This novel is post-Blade Runner(despite Gibson's denial of its influence), and although this book give us ""cyberpunk,"" it's arguable that Ridley Scott's classic really started it all, with the dark, rain-soaked thoroughly digitally-infested culture completing the prognosticative canon of Heinlein and Dick et al. But not to take away from Gibson in the least; he is offering up a lot here, and it all holds together extremely well.I kept wondering throughout: why hasn't this been made a movie yet? CGI is definitely mature enough now to take on the visuals this story would require. Well, there's enough saga about that, too, with a movie all set for 2011, or then again, maybe not. Read all the gossip somewhere else.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As a story--outside of its enduring significant cultural influence, lexicological contributions, and highly accurate vision--it reads well, quick and easy to follow. This is not a long book, and the story gets up and moves out. The story is not quite a quest, but it's a mystery that offers sex and violence, ranges quickly across a constantly fascinating physical landscape, and for those inclined, offers an incredible view of what electronic intelligence and the ephemeral realm it inhabits will become.On the downside, the Beat-like prose with its stream of consciousness flow and unique slang, and a lot of non-standard grammatical constructs and terms could throw a reader expecting something more. Lots of sentences begin without subject or its pronoun, the narrative serving as an internal monologue; it's the same with the dialog, which to my mind is highly realistic. One reviewer has mentioned ""unexplained jargon,"" and I can see this as a legitimate beef. Most of the jargon is very clearly defined in context immediately. There are some terms, though, that are sly cultural or technological references, and if you aren't familiar with the basis, then you really are lost, with the only hope being to see the term used again to pull its meaning.What really made this book for me is theJack Womackepilogue, really a short essay on how Gibson created cyberspace. It started off as a fawning note on how incredibly great Gibson is, but when I was done with its 16 pages, I'd written down Womack's name, with full intent to read some of his work. His writing is excellent, fast, direct, witty and irreverent. My intent to read Womack was sealed when he told of presenting Gibson with McCarthy's brilliantBlood Meridian, the ultimate gift of the greatest living writer's writer, from one to another.Bottom line: This is an amazing sci-fi classic, brilliant in its now twenty-six-year-old foresight. It's not hard-core sci-fi in terms of time/space travel, aliens, laser weapons and the like, but it's got enough future vision to make up for it. It's a simple story, told in an original and compelling manner, delivering to us a still-unrealized future where artificial intelligence may be the next step in human evolution."

Far from being a true or accurate of the shifting face of Christmas in modern society, he has instead crafted a crass and fact-deficient political screed that's keyed to the Coulter/Limbaugh crowd. This isn't a book meant to inform or explain; it's a book meant to misinform and inflame a religious base against any and all alternative ideas about Christmas.

My single complaint with the book was the rather sudden appearance of God in the storyline; while I was aware of the fact that the book was classified as religious, I was still slightly disappointed by Carlson's need to get the message of God out as the only way to truly quit cutting.However, I still believe that this book can be a wonderful resource for creating a bridge of understanding between a teenage cutter and their parents, and for giving all involved a sense of hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel."

Henry short story anthologies; I read both each year. It's somewhat surprising that they are not more popular, since they expose the reader to a wide variety of the best writers and writings, and since short stories can be easily fit into the busiest of lifestyles, especially plane and train rides.Having now read both 2003 editions, I would give the edge to this year's Best American anthology. The collection of stories that guest editor Walter Mosley has chosen are, in general, more readable, more entertaining, and cover a broader range of human emotions, subject matter, and genres. I would also rate the 2003 Best American anthology as a better-than-average or even a vintage year.I especially enjoyed the two ""genre"" stories included, a horror story and a science fiction story. Each is memorable not because of the aspects of their plots that classify them in their genre, but for what they reveal about human nature. Dan Chaon's ""The Bees"" shows the dangers of keeping secrets in an attempt to escape the past, and Ryan Harty's ""Why the Sky Turns Red When the Sun Goes Down"" contains a bizarrely fascinating plot element (a robotic child for couples unable to conceive their own), but what it actually illustrates is the difficult decisions parents make about their children, the immense power they have over them, and the changing relationships when a couple becomes a threesome by having a child.Other highlights: Susan Straight's ""Mines"", which is a stark, realistic portrayal of the tough choices facing people on both sides of the U.S. criminal justice system; Mary Yukari Water's ""Rationing"", which illustrates the generational differences in Japanese society; and Anthony Doerr's ""The Shell Collector"", which is the only story chosen for inclusion in both the Best American and O. Henry anthologies (and rightfully so). Interestingly, there are actually two pairs of stories concerned with similar plot elements (robotic children, and father/son relationships after the mother has passed away), but each pair is very different. This shows why this collection is so strong: it's not so much due to the plot of each story, but rather to what each story says about the human condition.Since choosing favorite stories is such a subjective process, each reader will no doubt have their own favorites. However, this year's Best American anthology provides plenty of good stories from which to choose your own favorites."

When reading Magic Time you may learn something, you will certainly feel something, and all the while your mind will forget itself as the read continues.

As you read about the evil of racism that was and still is a factor in all regions of our nation, Doug Marlette will remind you that evil rarely introduces itself for easy identification. Racism is an evil that Magic Time will not let the reader forget. What strikes this reader is that Doug Marlette doesn't hide behind the mask of explanation or run from the nudity found in the truth but presents a story to the reader for their own interpretations. Wow, what a concept, tell the story, present the reality, and accept the consequences of that honesty. Even the intellectually gifted can come down from their lofty perch of literary reference, pause in their instruction, and consider the fact that most us want a good story that teaches good over evil.

0805838333,"The Positive Psychology of Buddhism and Yoga, 2nd Edition: Paths to A Mature Happiness",,A348AQ14EWL58G,M. Hill,18/18,5.0,1122940800,Promises to be a Classic,"This book is both a wonderful introduction to the psychological frameworks of Buddhism and Yoga (B&Y;) and--most importantly--a practical guide to applying these systems to develop greater emotional maturity and overall wellbeing. According to Levine, the path to mature happiness developed in the ancient philosophies of B&Y; requires calming one's conditioned beliefs and ""passions"" to allow greater control by the ""anterior mind"" (the ""mind's eye"" capable of observing, contemplating, and directing the mind). At the extreme, an ""immature"" individual is entirely conditioned by his or her culture, language, and biology--yielding the positive functions of anterior mind nonfunctional. Much like a little child, such a person's mental state is completely at the mercy of the external environment. He/she feels alright when a craving or ego desire is fed--but falls into tantrums and anguish whenever a craving or desire cannot be satisfied. Moreover, perception and interpretation of external events are distorted by the conditioned mind and its many unchecked passions (ego needs, cravings and attachments, fears and aversions, antipathies and resentments). The result is a life filled with suffering and illusion.Fortunately, children typically do learn to moderate their most selfish behaviors as they grow to adulthood: ""[P]art of growing up entails learning some self-transformation"" (p. 54). Nevertheless, Levine points out that our American vision of ""normal"" allows for a mix of mature and immature behavior. ""Normal"" adults experience disquieting feelings (anger, pettiness, impatience, envy) quite regularly: e.g., when ""stuck"" in a traffic jam or when passed over for promotion at work. Because such unhappy events are common, many of us spend a great deal of time and energy feeling upset about one thing or another.Levine points out that we don't have to live that way. Through the cultivation of positive attitudes (harmlessness, truthfulness, trustworthiness, sexual restraint, nonmaterialism) and practices (mindfulness, yoga poses, meditation), the anterior mind is freed more and more to reflect upon one's own mental processes and even transform them for the better. Thus the daily agitations diminish and we feel a greater sense of equanimity and happiness.Viewing these ancient philosophies through the lens of American ""positive psychology,"" Levine succeeds in developing a powerful ""Yogic"" model of cognitive processing that shares much with Albert Ellis (e.g., A Guide to Rational Living), Aaron Beck (Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders), David Burns (e.g., Feeling Good), and Martin Seligman (e.g., Authentic Happiness). As such, this highly readable book makes a major contribution to American ""Cognitive Therapy."" But while mainstream cognitive approaches are limited to diverse techniques for coping with irrational thoughts or troubling events, the Yogic approach described by Levine is comprehensive and holistic. I have began working with these ancient ideas and practices -- my early results suggest a potential to transform every aspect of one's life (mental, emotional, spiritual)!"

Conservatism that we know today originated in the 1940's. Yes, there were some embarrassing and questionable figures that arose, but a foundation was being laid. The book is very intellectually and professionally written with a Christian moral ideology. Micklethwait and Wooldridge also offer comparisons to the rest of the world. The pages are chock full of numbers and poll data. I skipped over the chapter on the 2004 election, and I would have liked to of seen more concentration on conservative beliefs. There is also a short section dealing with the ""far right"". I very much question their position that it is dangerous or even fascist. Then I would say, it is not conservative or Right any more.The authors are actually very critical of the republicans. They go over some of the contradictions in Republican Party. A good portion is devoted to the last Bush. They also spend some time on the socialist Fabian Society; their power not only influenced the liberals and democrats but also republicans and some conservatives as well. They list out influential conservative magazines, institutes, and think tanks---more than I imagined there were. The authors say they are optimistic for the future of conservative growth.Conservatives deal in absolutes, while the liberal deals in relativism. Conservatism has lead to exeptionalism. Let's keep it that way. We should not be afraid to recognize the United States as exceptional. The authors do make good a point that a majority leans to the right, even democrats. I believe this to be true, but somehow they are being influenced to veer to the left by a few minority liberal fascists. I am curious of what the authors think of our country today."

B00005VOU7,Contact : a novel,,A2BABJHQ16CAG4,bangboon@radiks.net,0/0,5.0,878428800,Contact is a masterful work of literary art.,"Carl Sagan's Contact is truly the most masterful work of literary art published in the twentieth century. The novel, originally published in 1985, and the posthumously released film that followed in 1997 are among the most fascinating and moving stories of all time. Human words can hardly describe the emotions, sensations, and fascinations triggered by reading this gripping book. Even the most skeptic and cynical reader will be forever touched by this enchanting novel. It mesmerizes a reader like no other novel can.Contact is the only novel written by the late astronomer Carl Sagan. He should have written more. He was the only man in all the years of his study of science to boost anyone's interest in this fascinating field to the extent that he did. I also strongly recommend his many other books, including Cosmos, Comet, Broca's Brain, and Pale Blue Dot, just to name a few.Contact flawlessly debates and explains many prepossessing topics at once, all while telling a spellbinding story of the seemingly endless quest for truth. It is about the search for meaning and fidelity in our troubled lives. It gives us an answer to our questions about the constant battles between scientific proof and faith. Sagan predicts the future of the universe through this spectacular narrative. I'm happy with his answer."

B000NPAT6W,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave. Written by Himself",,A75FAUW3VXNKL,Joshua M. Clark,7/9,5.0,1063843200,Revealing,"A prime subject of debate before the Civil War seems to have been the nature of slavery in the South. Northern abolitionists would shoot rhetorical darts concerning the ineffable cruelties done to slaves at the hands of Southern slaveholders; Southern Confederates would fire their own salvos in return, telling stories to show that the abuses did not outweigh the general decency of the system. In this autobiography, Frederick Douglass weighs in heavily with the abolitionists, laying bare the barbarity and brutality of his experiences with slaveholders in the South. Tracking his life from the ignorance of childhood, to his growing awareness and education, to his final escape, Douglass makes his opinion plain: It is not only the South's particular form of slavery which is savagely corrupt - the system itself is despicable at its core.My college assigned me this book to read, suggesting I watch for two things: the relationship of Christian faith to his life and to that of his masters, and the role of education in his journey toward freedom. In regard to the first, Douglass actually says surprisingly little about how his faith sustained him throughout his captivity. A few brief mentions are made here and there about how Christianity strengthened him during his trials, but the vast majority of his remarks on Christianity addressed the viciousness it seemed to inspire in his masters. In his experience, pious slaveholders were more cruel and malicious than unbelievers. Indeed, one of his worst masters was reverend of a local church. Douglass explains that while religion is well and good in its proper state, the corruption of the Southern version of Christianity was unpardonable, a religion where piety begot brutality, and faith sanctioned savagery.In my reading of this narrative, Douglass' primary hope was not in Christianity, but in education. Throughout the book, he explains the various devices slaveholders used to keep their slaves from getting religion, or getting reading and writing, or getting knowledge of current events. He shows that the Southerners knew exactly what they were keeping from their slaves - the very tool by which they could gain liberty, humanity, and freedom. Douglass traces his tortuous trials in learning to read and write, and then shows the invaluable benefits he received from these. A good education is one of the greatest and most liberating things a person can get, and Douglass' narrative drives this point home hard and clear.This book is a worthwhile read. Engaging and well-written, this narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass fascinates and informs. It illustrates the cruel treatment he, and by extension many other slaves, received at the hand of Southern slaveholders. It shows how a barbaric form of Christianity inspired some of these cruelties. And it shows how education delivered Douglass from the hands of his oppressors. Read it as a history. Read it as a story. But by all means, read it."

B0007I1MVG,My Theodosia (A Pyramid book),,A3R1E4K7B6RUHP,Michele,1/1,4.0,1259625600,Charming,"Over the past few months I have been reading, or re-reading, all of Anya Seton's works, and I just finished re-reading My Theodosia, which I first read several years ago. One of the things I like about Anya Seton's historical ""biographies"" is that, rather than write about the popular figures who are already the subject of countless biographies, and whose stories we already know, she instead focuses on the lesser-known minor players of history. My Theodosia, Devil Water and The Winthrop Woman all tell the stories of people that history has largely forgotten. It is probably even likely that Katherine Swynford wasn't so well-known to the general public until Anya Seton wrote a book about her.In My Theodosia, Seton's first book, she points her pen at Theodosia Burr Alston. Although the book is about Theodosia, the real ""main character"" of this story is actually Theodosia's relationship with her father, the scheming, self-serving, but fascinating scoundrel Aaron Burr. Their father/daughter relationship was truly remarkable; while Burr was in many ways ahead of his time in his views of women, and in the way he raised and trained his daughter, at the same time he maintained a Svengali-like hold over her throughout all of her short life. She ultimately sacrificed everything -- even her chance at true love -- on the altar of devotion to her father.I think what will be most troublesome about this book to modern readers is the way Seton depicts slaves in the South (""protruding lips around enormous white teeth, slate-back skin, and rolling eyes"") and her frequent use of the ""n"" word. I had to remind myself that she was 1) presenting blacks as they probably would have seemed to an upper-class young girl from the North in the days when slavery was still an ingrained institution in both North and South and blacks were widely considered less than human, and 2) this book was written in the 1940s, long before the days of civil rights or sensitivity to such issues.My Theodosia is a charming peek into upper-class American life in the very early 1800's, and the author weaves in vignettes of some of the early American greats (James and Dolly Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Washington Irving). Seton managed to paint a vivid picture of the time and place without fulsome or verbose descriptions, a style she maintained throughout all her books. Aaron Burr's escapades fill the book as they filled his daughter's life, and woven throughout is a bittersweet love story of Theodosia and the true love of her life. Although this is not Anya Seton's strongest work, it is highly enjoyable."
0821772023,Love's Charade,6.99,,,7/8,5.0,923875200,One Of Jane Feather's Best Books Ever,"I adored this book! I read it for the first time two years ago and have since re-read it once every couple of months. The age difference between the characters is handled so well that I felt it enhanced the love story rather than detract from it. So many romance novels portray marriages with large age gaps as horrific ones in which wives suffered abuse, neglect, oppression or worse. It was refreshing to see a novel that positively portrayed what was an inescapable historical reality for the eighteenth century. Brava Ms. Feather! You have created a wonderfully spirited and independant heroine and given her a man mature enough to appreciate and understand her strenghth and drive instead bieng threatened to the point of unreasonable domination, as I believe a younger man of the period would have been. This is a thoughtful and deep novel with many levels. It is not a light read but a wonderfully touching one that reminds me, particularly after reading one of Ms.Feather's more current 'light' novels, why I love the author enough to buy her with no additional endorsment but the name Jane Feather on the cover."
B000GVAT0O,Symmetry,,A1S3C5OFU508P3,Charles Ashbacher,6/6,5.0,1149552000,An excellent introduction to the concept of symmetry,"Symmetry is a fundamental characteristic of most living creatures, some natural features such as crystals, the basis of some mathematical models and a beautiful form of art. Most animals possess a form of bilateral symmetry, with only minor differences our right and left sides are mirror images of each other. Weyl gives examples of all of these types of symmetry, images with text explaining the details regarding the symmetry of the object.At the end, he gives the mathematical explanations of the symmetries, how they can be combined into the construct known as a group. The symmetries can then be sequentially combined to perform multiple actions and generate other actions. This dual examination provides a great deal of insight into the idea of symmetry. Biologically, it is clear that there must be powerful evolutionary advantages to symmetry, as it is universal in the animal kingdom. Humans also have a natural affinity for symmetric objects, as symmetry is a universal theme in the art work of cultures with little or no contact between them.Weyl has written an excellent introduction to the concept of symmetry. It is an idea that is easy to understand and the different motions of a symmetric object are a very good way to begin the study of group theory. Artists can also obtain some benefit from the additional knowledge of symmetry that they will get from this book."
B000EXYZOK,Letters to a Young Conservative,,A2SVKHKIEZ0L86,Anthony Adler,14/51,1.0,1036281600,Political romanticism,"Among the many rather peculiar claims made by Dinesh D'Souza in his ""Letters to a Young Conservative,"" there is one that I find particular striking. D'Souza asserts that whereas people go into business because they desire money, they go into Academia because they desire power. This implies, first of all, that a desire for power doesn't play a role in the desire for money, and, secondly, that the desire for power plays a more essential role in academia than in other professions. Both the first and second claim are, at the very least, rather odd. Money is clearly not an end in itself; it exists principally as an abstract representation for the labor of other people. If you have money, you can purchase other people's labor - either directly, by paying wages to an employee or a servant - or by buying a commodity, which itself contains an accumulation of social labor. Now even if we assume that this labor is entirely uncoerced and free, it is still clear that the right to claim other people's labor to one's own ends is a form of power. Unless businessmen have no other desire than to wallow day and night in a vault filled with gold, we must assume that their desire for money is also a desire for power.If we are not to suppose that D'Souza is a complete fool, there is only one way we can interpret what he means by this. Of all the manifold forms of human power (over desires, over wills, over bodies, over nature, over machines), he must regard only one of these to be power in the emphatic sense; namely, the form of power that is particular to the Academic profession. What is this then? Since the political power of an academic is slight, since they do not have the power over emotions and desires claimed by the mass media, since lawyers and advertisers (not to speak of politicians) are far better at befuddling the minds of the masses with sophisms, and since elementary and high school teachers have more influence over forming the basic prejudices and presuppositions of citizens, there is only one possibility left: the power to persuade and convince through argument and discourse, the power to teach people to think. The power, in other words, that people have over other people qua rational beings - and thus not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself. While other, less honorable forms of power play a role in Academic life, only this is specific and essential to it. This exemplary form of power, moreover, must stand in the strongest opposition to that which money grants to its possessors. We might understand this as follows: the labor that we purchase involves, implicitly and necessarily, a temporary suspension of will on the part of the seller. If I hire a servant to do my bidding for eight hours a day, then, during this period, he becomes a means to my ends. He ceases to exist qua rational, as an end in himself, and becomes an instrument. If I hire an employee to work in my business, it is no different. He may use his intelligence and creativity to the highest degree, he may enjoy what he is doing, he may want to work even if he did not have to: none of this matters. He is still serving my ends for the duration of his labor. And likewise when I buy some produce or manufactured good, although now I have an indirect rather than direct relation to the labor. What the worker gets in return, in each case, is the same --- money, which confers a like power to purchase the labor of others.Thus it becomes clear: for D'Souza, power in the true sense consists only in rational persuasion. Contractual relations, and above all, those in which someone freely agrees to temporally suspend his freedom in exchange the means to purchase the labor of others, are not relations of power, but something else. (A real Marxist, and not just a ""liberal"", would, of course challenge the very freedom and symmetry of this contractual relation, observing that, in relation of capitalists and workers, and very different power is exchanged, and it is not nearly as reciprocal as it may at first seem.) And power, for D'Souza, is a bad thing.It is easy to see, however, that this conception is deeply flawed - not merely because it disregards the tremendous variety in forms of power, but because it entirely conflates the means and the end, the accidental and the essential. Rational persuasion is superficially and instrumentally asymmetrical: one party persuades and the other is persuaded. Likewise, the University is an extraordinarily hierarchical institution. Yet the end of rational persuasion is a free community of rational beings, who, in good Kantian fashion, regard each other not as means but as ends. The market exchange, mediated by money, is instrumentally equal and reciprocal. Yet its end is the subjection of one person's will to another. And when all relations are mediated by money, the subjugation becomes universal.I have submitted this remark of D'Souza's to an extended analysis not because I consider his book a worthy target of such critique, --- it is obviously extremely vapid and opportunistic, especially with its kitsch conceit of ""mentoring,"" --- but because I believe it to reveal an extremely characteristic presupposition of the contemporary Conservative Weltanschauung. All human relations are understood as instrumental, - abandoned is the very hope of a society in which people regard each other as ends - and yet the sober analysis of the modes of power and domination is replaced with the ideological conviction that the contractual relations of a ""free market economy"" are intrinsically non-repressive; that they are, as it were, the immanent realization of utopia. This is political romanticism at its worst."
B000GSDG8E,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",,AVGROVWIE1RRL,Charles Bradley,2/2,3.0,1171152000,Motivational speaker in print,"Here are the main themes of this book. Start early to save. When you have money, buy things thatwill make money for you (stocks, bonds, rental real estate, etc.) instead of things that willcause you extra expenses or will depreciate. Hire someone to run your businesses so you have timeto make more money. Have capital gains instead of salary. Take some chances. You have to buy beforeyou can sell at a profit.There is more, of course, and different people might select different main ideas.The book reminded me of a motivational speaker. It is best for the reader that has a strong,burning ambition to be very, very, very rich. It is for those whose goal is more money and whosehobby is also more money. I suspect it is fine for them.Those that want enough money to not have to worry about money, or those with more modest goals,will probably find other books more useful. The first two ideas are useful for all.Also read ""The Millionaire Next Door."" Besides comparing the two books, it might be interesting tocompare the people that favored each."

B0009QRZQ2,The Stranger,,A16651OR9QNJ2Y,"nlonghu ""nebula""",2/10,5.0,1115683200,The meaning of Absurd,"Absurd, in the sense that Camus uses it, has less to do with the everyday notion of ""ridiculous"" or ""non-sensical"" as some reviews here suggest, but with the idea that we seek some universal, transcendental meaning for Life in a universe essentially devoid of meaning.That Meursault is defined by many readers as ""insensitive"" or ""bizarre"" or ""abnormal"" simply reveals a basic need to categorize Meursault in a value system. However, this is precisely what Camus puts into question: assuming and applying values in a universe where values have no place or meaning is absurd. It is a futile gesture. This is what makes the court scene the absurdity it is, as it confronts someone who is evidently amoral and then condemns him in the name of all that is right and decent in society. ""Right"" and ""decent"" are the precious ideas we collectively fabricate for ourselves and maintain in order to help us feel that there is an essential order and justice in the universe and that there is a ""right"" and ""wrong"" distinguishable to all. But Camus book suggests--without denying the usefulness of such ideas--that this is a human thing: Meursault's actions (killing an Arab, not crying at his mother's funeral) are devoid of meaning ...from a universal perspective.Everybody dies anyway, so what difference how and whether sooner or later? That's just the way things are.Now, a thought experiment for those who keep Camus and his ideas at a safe reading distance: imagine witnessing a car accident...where children are involved. This happened to me in Madrid over 8 years ago, where I witnessed from a distance one maniac car tearing right through the car of a lone mother...with kids. The ramming car didn't stop: it just tore on. I shan't give any more details, as it is too painful. Now think, for a split second, how every feeling of horror, distress, and ultimately anger...the awfulness of it all. Then consider, if you can, the comforting stories offered by priest or psychologist to the remaining family. Perhaps you are the remaining kin. How profoundly inadequate and futile these must seem to cover one's sudden, naked exposure to the obvious indifference of the universe. Any attempt to give meaning to the event seems completely at odds with what suddenly, inexplicably happened. It just happened. That is all. The universe remains, unchanged. The word ""tragedy"" may provide an inadequate handle on events. But the senselessness, meaningless of it all has been glimpsed."
B000G9YMPE,Wide Sargasso Sea,,A6FIAB28IS79,Samuel Chell,4/4,5.0,1263427200,"An answer to Empire, and perhaps a sliver of light on Haiti","This is a deceptive book--at first glance it appears much shorter and more accessible that its putative motivator and predecessor, Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre."" But the novel is fragmented, impressionistic, a pastiche of dreams and shifting viewpoints from inscrutable narrators. It's not at all an easy story to grab on to, yet it contains passages of undeniable evocative power, ranging from the Dionysian seductiveness of the tropics to the hysteria of a land in oppression and revolt.The reader who stays with the story--not once but two or three times--will be amply rewarded by an author capable of suggesting so much more than what appears on the surface. Rhys conveys the island culture, exposes its people and classes, but she also penetrates the psyche of a proud and brutal British colonist as well as the inner realm of fear and desire belonging to his prey: a woman and a culture in flux, both more wronged against than the other way around.The reader looking for a sequel to ""Jane Eyre"" is bound to be initially disappointed. Bronte establishes a style that, among its excellences, comes to represent an authoritative narrator and a decidedly confident Western point of view (albeit from a woman's angle of vision rather than a man's). By contrast, Rhys' style is so different as to strike the first-time reader as that of someone speaking, writing, and thinking in a language other than English--a language that the reader only gradually recognizes as his own.But that's much the novel's point--the strangeness and disorientation resulting from the invasion of a defenseless island by a stable, civilized, patriarchal society frustrated by its inability to assert its customary order and, above all, control. The Bertha Mason the reader meets in this story may be disappointing, unrecognizable, a construction as far removed from Bronte's and the reader's experience as a character from a completely different world. But that's who Bertha Mason is, the ""real"" Bertha Mason--and her difference should in no way exclude her from the reader's sympathy, curiosity, and desire to know more about her. Unlike the unnamed Rochester (who is certainly no less a stranger, especially to himself, than Bertha), the challenge for the reader (and all of us) is to learn from her and through her--the better to know ourselves.Though we may find the nightly television images from Haiti disturbing, we cannot afford to avert our eyes, to close our pocketbooks, to dissociate ourselves from the people of Haiti even as they die festering in the streets awaiting the bulldozers to plough them under. Bronte had some vague notion of the painful consequences of depriving others of their freedom, running heedlessly over their identities, and finally simply hiding them in some dark attic and throwing away the key. Paradoxical as it may seem, this latest catastrophe may be a first step toward unlocking the door. Contrary to Robertson, Limbaugh, and some of the other false prophets who purport to have access to higher wisdom, Haiti may not be God's punishment but our opportunity. The punishment could come should we fail to act to right a situation that next time could be much worse--and closer to our own shores.[Note: Despite Amazon's reference to the edition (above), this is the novel by Jean Rhys.]"

B000N7HJ86,Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,,AZQ6PYDEJQJEF,"Staring Girl ""Staring Girl""",2/3,5.0,1125532800,"My ""re-education""","During 1966 to 1976 China went through a cultural revolution inaugurated by Mao Zedong attempting to prevent development of a bureaucratized Soviet style of Communism. As a result, schools were closed, teachers and intellectuals were persecuted and people were encouraged to join Red Guard Units which enforced Mao's cult of personality. It is during this chaotic time in China that `Balzac and the little Chinese seamstress' take place.It is interesting to me the way this book was written. The story is told as if you are sitting with the narrator as he casually tells you his story. Since the novel is written this way, you never get the name of the narrator, only the names of the people involved in his life. The novel vividly paints the story of the main character and his best friend Luo and their trials of their segregated life of ""re-education"". The two seventeen-year-old boys are condemned to serve four years of this ""re-education"" living in a shack on a remote mountain performing tedious tasks such as carrying buckets of excrement for disposal and working tiring hours in fields.Despite their impecunious living conditions, the boys manage to entertain themselves by story-telling and by the narrator playing his violin. The headman catches wind of their amazing story-telling ability and orders them to periodically go into town to watch a movie, then come back and retell it in graphic detail. The boys encounter a beautiful young girl in town who works with her father as a seamstress. Luo is stricken by her beauty, but will not consider her for a wife until the girl becomes sophisticated and cultured. This presents them with a dilemma until (by chance) they come across a suitcase of forbidden Western literature. The boys devour each book while at the same time sharing the stories with the little seamstress. These books have a profound effect on the lives of everyone involved.The story was very well told and engrossing. It was a very short and easy read (only just shy of 200 pages). I read the book in just a couple hours while on a road trip. I think this would be a great read for young adults. It makes you see how lucky we all are to have such a vast range of books so readily available to us."
0738209562,"Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It",,AAMQ7AWS6ENEK,"Winston Chan ""Please visit my blog!""",19/24,3.0,1294790400,An informative book suffered by redundancy and other issues,"Like a vast majority of college students, I suffer from procrastination. Throughout my career, I was trapped in a perpetual cycle, where each ""end"" was another promise to myself to reform my ways and be cured of this disease. Yet after that brief catharsis between the end of a deadline and the approaching of another, I see myself again stuck in limbo, cursing myself in my inability to change. And of course, through this sickness, I can see myself suffer academically and physically, churning out sub-par grades that I hope that I have the capability of doing better. With this in mind, I see this book as much needed medicine.From the start, you are told that procrastination is something that can be solved (yay!) and has several psychological, cultural, and biological underlying factors than previously thought (I thought it was just my laziness..). The authors then proceed and tell how knowledge of these factors are crucial before you are able to help yourself (uh-oh...I don't like where this book is headed..). Thus the first part of the book is comprised of all the different ways that you procrastinate and finally the book is concluded by how you can overcome these obstacles. All in all, this book was extremely informative (super dense), yet I have a lot of issues with this book.With the first part of the book, I constantly felt as if I was being pried of my private life. It was as if this book was not a helpful guide, but instead a personal shrink finding the root of all the distress in my life. It then gives a ridiculous amount of examples in restating these different roots that we feel. I found some of it relevant to my life, but it eventually I felt as if it was a chore reading all these problems. Of course, to save my sanity I quickly skimmed the rest, hoping the book will give life-changing advice in the second part of the book.With the second part of the book, I found the information useful and practical. Yet, as I continued through this section, it again suffered from the faults of the first half. It was completely redundant, emphasizing certain key concepts to death. Again, I could not take this redundancy, so I skimmed the rest picking the most relevant and interesting parts to critically read.TL;DR All in all, I believe this book is fully informed on the topic of procrastination, yet it could better present itself in a manner that is more efficient."

Wheeler, MA",33/33,5.0,1024012800,A Must-Have Book for your First Aid Kit,"Dr. Dean provides us with a comprehensive and easy to follow guide to treating our everyday medical complaints. She writes this book for the layperson, guiding us to use remedies that are easy to find in our local health food stores. One can tell that she has seen these remedies work and that she believes in them. I have read books of remedies in the past but they are presented in a theoretical fashion. Dr. Dean is writing from experience! What I love about this book is that she clearly describes what can cause the ailment, what the variety of symptoms might be, and how to deal with very specific symptoms using herbs and/or homeopathy. When I have looked up a particular illness, I have come away with easy-to-do solutions that worked. Yes they worked.In addition to the compendium of health problems and treatments, Dr. Dean provides us with a straightforward description of homeopathy and how it works. Accompanying this description is a listing of different homeopathic and herbal remedies and the very precise conditions that they are used to treat.I particularly enjoyed the section of the book entitled Advice and Information. Dr. Dean gives her `natural' insight to illuminate topics like antibiotics, surgery, x-rays, and dieting. Without being preachy, Dr Dean encourages us to consider the impact of non-natural substances in our food and environment.In conclusion, Dr Carolyn Dean's Natural Prescriptions for Common Ailments is a practical, easy to follow and valuable guide to self-care using natural substances. An extra bonus is that it is a really interesting and informative book to just sit down and read. It is for these reasons that, as a health practitioner, I recommend this book to my clients."

B0006VYG62,The Bell Jar : A Novel (Perennial Classics),,A3LXVFEOEFRPYU,Amy,6/7,4.0,961286400,Haunting and Unforgettable,"The overall theme of this book was human suffering. The author explored themes related to this, such as the human mind, struggle, suicide, and young women's positions in society during the 1940s and 50s: more specifically, how this society refuses to take women's aspirations seriously. However, the general theme and certainly the best explored idea of this book would be human suffering and madness. The author explores this well, probably because this was an autobiography. Sylvia Plath obviously understands at the deepest level the theme of this novel; it being a theme in her own life. First Plath explores how suffering begins and develops in a person. In this book, it is not actually clear what brought on the main character's terrifying internal battles and descent into madness. But the development is portrayed clearly; the stages of self doubt turning constant feelings of having no worth whatsoever. The character (as Plath calls herself, Esther) accuses herself of being useless in a society that has no place for her. And so begins a spiraling, quick decline in this young woman as she descends into a life of self mutilation. Throughout this novel, Esther contemplates suicide frequently: ""But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrists looked so white and defenseless against the blade of my Gillete that I just couldn't do it."" However, after following multiple attempts at suicide, Esther finally manages to overdose on enough sleeping pills as to land herself in the hospital. Shortly after she is sent to a Psychiatric Ward, where it is expected Electroshock Treatments will cure her depression. After endless, blurry days full of pain and misery, her condition improves. Esther is released from the Ward and is almost herself again. Around this time in her life, Plath completed the book The Bell Jar and produced a plethora of poetry, all astounding pieces of work. By this time she was married to a poet, Ted Hughes, and had two children. Although she was said to be hopeful and optimistic during these days of her life, on the morning of February 11, 1963, Plath ended her life without explanation. This book conveys a journey of an individual's personal experience with human suffering. The theme is well explored by the author, to the extent where the novel was criticized for being hitting the reader with such disturbing impact. I, as well, found this novel to be disturbing. Sylvia Plath dug deep into the landscape of the human mind and eloquently portrayed darkness, disillusion, and despair."

I decided to start in chronological order with Carrie. Carrie is the story of an awkward teen that has been continually picked on her entire life and finally takes her revenge upon the world using long-dormant powers. In a sick sort of way you kind of root for her to take the entire town out. At any rate it is one of Stephen King's best stories with enough pulse-pounding anxiety to make you want to read the entire story in one sitting. Thankfully it is really short and you can easily burn through it in a few hours. A true masterpiece from the master of horror."

First of all this book contains quite a few twists and turns so buckle up and you will be in for a ride. Our hero, Paul Janson, is a retired operative who is lulled back for a job. A philantropist Peter Novak is kidnapped by rebels from a small country which is close to Sri Lanka. He is to be a mediate between the goverment and the rebels but instead he is captured. Novak's foundation hires Janson to rescue him but alas, everything goes wrong and Novak and Janson's men do not make it. Next thing you know is that his own agency and goverment and guns for hire are after him. It is a long chase for him to get away from the people who are after him and also to find out who and why he is being hunted.Along the way one of the people who tries to kill him, Jessica Kincaid, eventually becomes an ally and helps to find out what is actually going on. They keep on running into stone walls and sharp turns. As we go along we meet quite an interesting collection of indiviuals with the best being the Russian, Grigori Berman, who since the fall of the Soviet Union has been trying to an Englishman. The way he goes about it is a hoot.All in all the book is enjoyable from the first to the last page with no stops in between.

B0007PC4YI,Hard Times,,A4FX5YCJA630V,"R. M. Fisher ""Raye""",5/6,4.0,1151884800,"""Facts Alone are Wanted in Life...""","A book called ""Hard Times"" doesn't sound like the type of book you'd pick up for some light, cheerful reading, but you shouldn't judge a book by its cover - or its title either. ""Hard Times"" certainly deals with a difficult subject, but thanks to the genius of Dickens, it never becomes unbearably depressing.At the centre of the novel are the upheavals of the mid-1800s that changed the world forever: the rise of the Industrial Revolution, mass manufacturing and capitalism, and the rural-to-urban flow that led to compulsory schooling and shocking living conditions for vast amounts of the English population. The Enlightenment was gaining in popularity, as was the bourgeois class, which was gradually outing the old aristocracies. It was a time of drastic social and economic change, and inevitably many less-fortunate people fell down the cracks in the new system. With all this as his background, Dickens creates various characters of differing classes and the impact such social changes had in their lives. Exploring the phenomena on individual, familial and social levels, Dickens reveals some of the pain and misery that plagued his time-period, and is still very much relevant to our present day condition.What is vitally important to understand is that reading ""Hard Times"" is reading history - in more ways than one. As a philanthropist who investigated the factory conditions of the working class, Dickens not only vividly describes the situation as he saw it with his own two eyes, but threw light on the cruelty that was at work to the general public (before there was investigative journalists, there were novelists). It was partly because of the publicity that Dickens raised in regards to factories and workhouses that philanthropists came to the aid of the poor and that laws were passed in order to secure better conditions for the lower classes. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.Thrown into the mix of this great social and political satire are a range of vivid (though often one-dimensional characters) of all classes and situations who all dwell in the industrial town of Coketown, described as ""a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it...a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled."" Out of this miserable place comes Sir Thomas Gradgrind, a man uninterested in anything but facts - at school, at home and in life in general. His children Louisa and Thomas are the products of a strictly factually-based education; as a result she is clinically depressed (as we would describe it in modern terms) and her brother turns to cards and drinking in order to alleviate his boredom with the world. Among the lower-class is Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking older man who is in love with fellow worker Rachael, but because of his class is unable to divorce his drunken wife. Providing the lighter side of this dreary existence is the circus, which brings colour and enjoyment into the lives of the Coketown residents simply for its own sake, personified by Sissy Jupes, the daughter of a clown who brings a sense of fancy and spiritual understanding into the lives around her that mere facts don't even begin to provide.All of these lives, plus many more eventually collide in typical Dickens melodrama, with the clear message that imagination (or ""fancy"") and the need for simple pleasures in life are essential for the good of humanity. Whether it is in the strict classroom, the dismal workhouses or the familial unit, the human spirit will be crushed without some measure of light, laughter and enjoyment. As an extra bonus, ""Hard Times"" is one of Dickens's shortest novels; if you are a steady reader it shouldn't take you more than a week to complete!Some critique ""Hard Times"" as being too transparent in some of its themes and messages, and though this is probably true (with his characters representing different points of view, rather than being three-dimensional figures), this is precisely the point of the novel. Unlike ""David Copperfield"" or ""Great Expectations"", this is not a story that revolves around one particular character and their development, but rather an assemble piece that has the `hard times' as its main focus. Therefore, characters do not need to be anything but a representative of worldview; Mr Gradgrind as the strict rationalist, Bounderby as the hypocritical bourgeois member, Blackpool as the angelic poor man, Mrs Sparsit as a member of the fading aristocracy and Slackbridge as an ignorant trades-union agitator (proving that although Dickens had sympathy for the poor, he still believed that giving them *too* much power was a dangerous thing).These were hard times indeed, but this novel attempts to show that there is hope for humanity to see such times through to the other side."

You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.Heck ...

The pictures in the newer book are clearer and make it easier to pick out details you might need. There is also a very useful section on repairing body panels with two full pages of pictures.These manuals are based on rebuilding a working car. Real world accounts of people who deal with problems as they come up seem more useful.The section on headlights explains how to replace and aim the bulb, remove and replace the whole unit, and adjust the doors. If you look on the internet you'll find many questions, discussions, and tutorials about problems with the headlight motors, gears, and relays.

B0006C7CPI,"Silas Marner, the weaver of Raveloe",,,,3/3,3.0,929318400,Love those happy endings!,"This was a perfectly agreeable, though not exceptional, specimen of the 19th century British novel. Eliot was a very fine writer in the Victorian style, with an assured, elegant vocabulary and lofty moral sensibility. Like other authors of the period, she occasionally gets carried away with grandiose elliptical constructions yielding minor observations of human nature that could be conveyed much more simply. Here's one that occurs early on: &quot;For the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity. A shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants.&quot; Translation: powerless people distrust powerful people. Or this gem: &quot;a dull mind, once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic.&quot; Whew. Translation: people believe what they want to believe.OK, so sentences like these fall a bit humorously on modern ears, but that's half the fun of reading this stuff, and Shakespeare did it too. Anyway, these characters are very likeable and the story is engaging. You'll sympathize with poor Silas and fall in love with adorable Eppie, and everything turns out well in the end. It's not as great as Middlemarch, but it still delivers the goods."

Now we get to see how messed up their lives will be.Incase you missed Flowers in the Attic, it's about a greedy woman who decides to hide her kids in a attic from her father. He won't let her inherit if she had any kids from her uncle she was married too. This kids spent four years in the attic waiting for escape as they hit puberty together and commited incest.Now in Petals, we find Chris and Cathy trying to get on with their lives. We watch Cathy try to pull away from Chris, but he knows his sister is his soulmate.Petals is ok at best through most of it as it skips around a lot over several years of their lives. What kills me is Cathy. Just when you think she's going to be ok, she makes the dumbest decision in the world. Things seem ok, then Cathy gets lied too. The author skips a couple chapters of progression, and out of nowhere, Cathy is making the most idiotic decision ever. I won't spoil it, but this disgust me and makes Petals my least favorite under the name. If good writing is making a character so moronic that you can never forget her, then V.C Andrews is the best!But she's not the best. Remember the progression missing? Missing chapters? It's almost like she just decided to do what we won't expect just to tick us off. She tries to correct it later by saying Cathy is impulsive, but she's not. Not enough for this decision. No, this is the worst writing mistake of all time.These first two books are creative and one of a kind, but overall nothing special. They are average, but grabbed our attention as we hoped they would escape the attic and avoid incest. These two books get credit for the fame of the V.C Andrews name and get a ghost writer hired to write in her honor. It's important to remember how she got famous. She writes about tragedy. Usually a family member will do something unspeakable that rips everyone apart. Secrets, incest or forbidden romance, and main characters who are ok, then make a decision that will wreck their lives.The reason to remember this is because that is what the ghost writer is getting paid to imitate.In every book I can think of, he copies at least one of the area's that made her famous. And usually does it better. He gives us a hint of forbidden romance, but thankfully we don't actually see it. He makes us a good main character then has her make one decision that messes everything up. Usually his character decisions are a lot more realistic than Cathy's. He writes four series after this one that are all better. After reading them, I believe he's the reason the VC Andrews name is so popular. He writes some darn good books, then ruins them by the bad character decisions usually. He needs to write like her, to be under her name, but he doesn't have to ruin them. Like she did. If he'd only write for himself, some would be best sellers.Most V.C Andrews books cover tragedy and romance. Their not really a romance, but most have strong secondary romance plots. All most all of them grab us within the first chapter and keep us glued. The ghost writer gives us some amazing stories, but usually leaves us feeling sick as tragedy strikes. Just like this one, except better written."

Second, most of the earlier Step-by-Step books gave interesting, code-along examples right from the first chapter. This was the power and pleasure of the series. ""Look, mom! I'm coding!""This book delivers the first without accomplishing the second, unfortunately. Mcbucho from Cincinnati, Ohio is right. There's nothing worth coding until page 250 or so.Why? I'm not sure. Perhaps, it's because it takes 250 pages to explain the basics of the ASP.Net Framework, which you need to understand before you can write a half descent web app.I sure wouldn't want a bunch of coding examples showing every possible manipulation of the myriad of Web.Config elements and attributes. I just want a brief overview, so I know what's there to use, which the book does. I'll figure out how to use them as I go, ""Hey what does the &lt;compile> element do? ...(2 hours of tweaking go by)...Cool!""Perhaps, they used the ""Step-by-Step"" moniker because it was the best work Microsoft Press has done to date (In my humble opinion), and they wanted to capitalize on the name.In any event, the book does deliver what it promises to deliver: an overview that breaks down the various parts of creating ASP.Net apps, presented in such a way that a person with a fundamental skill level can understand.

Benjamin Barber is a political science professor at Rutgers University, and has written several books.The central theme of the book is that there are two competing worldviews in the post Cold War world. The first is what Barber calls 'McWorld,' which is essentially the economic consumption system based on control of information systems, and 'Jihad,' a nationalistic view that rejects McWorld and its consumption ideals while seeking to create autonomous ethnic enclaves. It is Barber's contention that these two competing views are endangering both the maintenance and spread of democratic institutions throughout the world. The reason this examination is essential, according to Barber, is due to the fact that nations facing Jihad contain most of the world's supply of oil. If Jihad is not contained or dealt with, the world could be faced with some sort of economic terrorism.Barber spends a lot of time discussing McWorld and all of its aspects. He discusses advertising, television influence (with a special emphasis on MTV), and media mergers. If McWorld is not contained, or at least made subservient to democratic ideals, it threatens to overwhelm and destroy democracy everywhere. Jihad is just as bad. Barber uses Russia and East Germany as case studies, where the violent insertion of McWorld and its value system (essentially Western culture) caused chaotic economic upheavals that left these two areas in serious economic depressions. The rise of a figure such as Zhirinovsky in Russia points to a potential fascist backlash against McWorld and its twisted values (this is dated, as Zhirinovsky is long gone from the Russian political scene).My problem with the book certainly doesn't come from world opposition to McWorld's use of Western values; I don't like the garbage spread about through ...TV anymore than an imam in Iran. I guess I take exception with his arguments about democracy. Who says democracy should be a world goal? Successful democracy involves an intricate series of temporal and geographical situations. What works here most likely won't work in Kuwait or Laos. Also, democracy eventually leads to tyranny when vigilance wanes. It did in Greece and it will here, too. Wasn't it democracy that gave rise to the very McWorld that Barber is railing against? In many places in the world, they will be better off without democracy.I don't think this book is too hard to get through,... Barber has a tendency to be glib with some of his word play, especially during his examination of McWorld. I'm still surprised that I enjoyed a book with a Barbara Ehrenreich blurb on the front cover."

The actual Tanakh quotes appear in normal, upright typeface (in bold) and how I wish the rest of the text was like this. The good thing about this book is it really encouraged me to get off my rump and learn the vocab down to a much lower frequency level so I don't have to use it any more.Pages have nice gold bible trim but there is no leaf page marker attached, but it's hard to complain too much when the thing is so inexpensive. Did I mention the terrible font choice?I hope the new version coming out in August, 2007 remedies this problem.OK, here's my updated review for the 2nd edition of this book. I purchased the second version which came out in 2007.It now *does* include a leaf page marker, but they still use the same horrible font.It's like they are trying to confuse the reader.It's really just too bad. I get the feeling some bigwig at the publisher invented this font so nobody wants to change it completely so as not to offend someone but please, please, use a normal Greek font like every other Greek bible I've ever seen.This item is for students, not masters, so why try to be different than all the rest? This is definitely one instance where conformity would be appreciated.I broke down and bought the UBS Reader's Greek New Testament (a competing product).It is much better for reading. The nice thing about this one by Zondervon is it's size. It's very very thin, whereas the UBS product is as thick and heavy as my Hebrew Reader's Old Testament.In summary, the font is terrible. The paper and cover are nice, and the bible leaf is handy. If you're gonna sit at a desk and not tote the thing around get the UBS version instead. If you like to travel light, get this one.I will not buy the 3rd edition unless they use a totally different and standard Greek font."

One wonders why generation after generation of teachers continues to tout this book as a ""classic"" when it's really far from enjoyable.The premise is interesting - youths coming of age during the World War era that's changing not only their future but their entire way of life. Unfortunately the characters, from prestigious, wealthy families who are more than just a little bit snotty - just can't hold the average reader's sympathy. Teens couldn't relate to them 30 years ago and can't now. The main character, furthermore, can't be referred to as a hero, since he deliberately wounds his best friend, and is indirectly responsible for his death. ""Did he do it on purpose?"" won't hold interest for hundreds of pages, and the fact remains that, whatever the reason, he DID do it either through deliberate cruelty or carelessness.

Matthews' writing as usual is phenomenal. My only complaint is with the sci fi aspect of the story, a child with telekinesis talents which just do NOT exist, and I was surprised given Matthews' obvious athiestic views in every one of his books. Plus he uses this as a ""deus ex machina"" to save some of his characters who would otherwise be dead if the child hadn't come to the miraculous rescue with her gift.However this book has LOTS of characters who are colorfully written. Some of them just fade out, not sure why they were there in the first place (many needed chapters given to an artist who paints a nude portrait of a prostitute who wants to be the mistress of the husband of the female sibling in the story.) But this is probably because Matthews is so prolific he just can't stop writing.The story builds up to where there should be a huge climax, but kind of fizzles out. The train chase at the end went on for pages and I skimmed and skipped that. There was an epilogue so we know the fates of all the characters, but also kind of anti-climactical. For the page-turning ability of this book, I give it 5 stars, but for the telekinectic character, 4 stars.I read this in about a week, couldn't put it down, may appeal to fans of Stephen King (who I no longer care for.)Lots of carnage, incest, child rape, a really, really nasty serial killer, basic Matthews menu, but so, so readable!!!!!"
B0000W70EC,Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan,,A2JN7IHOP5Z6B1,"Chai Trek ""roosting chicken""",0/0,4.0,1115769600,What One Risks One's Life For?,"On page 471, Elliot reveals his personal challenge: how to be still in the face of experience so that the task of keen observation is funneled neither towards a previously used emotion, nor directed towards an abstracted intellectual exercise. His goal is to ""fashion some intermediary vessel in which to bear the raw impressions of life...""so that he can experience ""a sort of stretching, a deepening of one's ability to stand up to life and absorb it as it happens.""Elliot thereby himself gives us the measure by which to assess his book. For me, as much as I marveled at his attention to detail, his willingness to describe landscape, the shapes of peoples faces, the things and human wares that make up a life, and as much as I so often felt his prose to convey an exact impression, nevertheless, I also felt that I needed him to be still, or rather, more still. By calling attention to them, his words too often get in the way of my reading experience and perhaps of his own desires.But Elliot's inability to reach his goal did not detract me from admiring the depth of his ambition. And there are many, many passages whose elegant beauty seems as simply perfect as Afghanistan's topography, culture, and people. There is no question that his knowledge and love of Afghanistan is great even as he regrets the limits of his understanding.For my needs this book answers a few questions that have long been my companions. First, for those trained in the hubris of modernity what kind of attitude, risk, and posture is necessary in order to find something of value in Afghanistan? Every page of this book is a tribute to a people and a place whose relative value -- to those who calculate life's worth in terms of utility instead of grace -- usually approaches zero. For his re-evaluation of Afghanistan alone Elliot deserves a hug strong enough to lift him off his feet.Second, as I read the countless times and ways in which Elliot risks his life, I wondered. I wondered about his sanity but also about whether he might have uncovered a way of being a warrior. Warriors, I have read, for example, in the soviet accounts of their experience in Afghanistan as well as in works inspired by the philosopher Hegel, are attracted to the spectacle of war. Their deepest motivations are grounded in the need to risk their lives for a perceived ethical cause. Klingons. As long as there is honor in risking one's life for such causes, there will be warriors. And war.In Elliot's account the warrior's motivations are transposed, internally one might say, so that risking one's life ennobles and enables the lives of others. He risks his life to find the value of others, not to de-humanize and then deprive them.Elliot might be surprised by how his writing triggered my thoughts on warriors. More likely, he might be intrigued and satisfied by my extension. He might think that the willingness to be still and observe the beauty and significance of particular moments in life is exactly what allows his readers to find their own resonance in his account. Through him, I find ""a sort of stretching, a deepening"" of my ability. For that, I offer him another hug and a cup of hot sweet chai.Finally, I must say what a sadness it was for me to approach the book's last few pages. I feel a loss for his company and guidance. We must live in interesting times if a book by an Afghan is crashing failure (The Kite Runner), whereas one written by the product of a former occupying empire, seems so redemptive."

1596009780,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio)),18.54,A1A0DOMWZRQ9XW,Tracy Lehman,2/13,2.0,1018396800,Alice's Adventures and the quality of dreams.,"""Alice in Wonderland"" was required reading for one of my present classes, if this had not been the case, I'm certain I would not have finished it for the sake of enjoyment. I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."

I bought this book instead of Schaum's Outline of Modern Physics (ISBN 0070248303) as it was out of print when I needed to buy it. Only 107 out of 527 pages of this book, which I bought, covers the chapters related to modern physics. Therefore, it does not, to my way of thinking, worth to buy it if Schaum's Outline of Modern Physics (ISBN 0070248303) is on stock. However, if this book, which I did not buy, is out of print. Then I have got another talk.Schaum's outline Beginning physics II: waves, electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics explains modern physics concepts very well indeed. More importantly, it solves problems clearly. Moreover, it helped me a lot in doing my homeworks problems quickly. Finally, it has a lot of solved problems of different ideas that I did not find in the textbook I used for this course, which was Modern Physics (ISBN 0030015472).I strongly believe that you can make use of this book not only in your modern physics, but also in freshman physics courses as it covers topics such as waves and electromagnetism, which I had already studied in my freshman year physics courses. So, this book could be helpful for you in more than two physics courses and, in that case, you will hit two birds with one stone if you buy this book. In addition, it is possible that you find Schaum's Outline of Modern Physics (ISBN 0070248303) to be not good. Then, in that event, you know the alternative: Make a beeline to this book.(Dear readers: Please note that I have rated only the modern physics chapters of this book)."

Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."

B0007H26VC,God and the ways of knowing (Meridian books),,A3BG43VR1XOTB5,"Aquinas ""summa""",9/11,5.0,1242345600,Brilliant,"Catholicisim unlke some forms of Protestantism is sympathetic to non-Christain including pagan beliefs because to cite Danielou ""pagan religions are like rays of cosmic revelation, refracted through a humanity spoiled by sin and not yet enlightened by positive revelation""... and ""The first characteristic of cosmic religion is that God is known in it, as St Paul said to the Romans through visible things.. the world is also a book that speaks to us of God"". Thus, catholicism finds in pagan practices and in its ""doctrine"" graspings after the truth. Thus, it is entirely appropriate to borrow these graspings so that they can find their rightful end. Hence, christianity borrows Saturnalia from the Romans to celebrate Christmas. In addition, it is appropiate to borrow from the great philopsphers of Antiquity, such as Plato and Aristotle, as St Thomas did so wonderfully.There is much more in this book including analysis of the mystical thought of the Fathers. A point I would also make is that the desire to sacrifice to the ""gods"" seems to have been prevalent in many, if not in all religions. Catholicism brings this inate desire to fullness in the Mass, where, at the Mass, the Priest, as the Alter Christus, represents to the Father, the sacrifice of the Son, in a bloodless sacramental form, and we, as the laity offer up or sufferings to the Father as co-suffers with Christ. And, the Father looks with pleasure on the offering of the Priest and our offerings and gives us the body, blood, soul and Divinity of his Son.I wrote this some time ago for Amazon (UK) but wonder now whether Girardian anthropology would change my analysis. For Girard, pagan sacrifices reflect an original scapegaoting event - they tell the story from the perspective of the victimisers. Jesus too is a scapegaot but the story is told from the perspective of the victim. The sacrifice to end all sacrifices.A brilliant book."

Moore,1/1,5.0,1030406400,Truly biting satire,"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its ""time travel"" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain ""invented"" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an ""aw shucks"", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called ""surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man."" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."

B000N79NHQ,Animal Farm 50TH Anniversary Edition,,A21W6PCDZWG15R,J C E Hitchcock,2/3,5.0,1106179200,The Biggest Pig in the Barnyard,"The story of ""Animal Farm"" is set on Manor Farm, where the animals are badly treated by their cruel and incompetent owner Mr Jones. A spirit of revolt grows among the animals, inspired by Major, the old boar, who develops a philosophy known as ""Animalism"", which urges animals to revolt against their human masters, to take control of the agricultural system and to run it in their own interests. After Major's death the animals seize their chance to rebel against Jones and succeed in ousting him and taking control of the farm, which they rename Animal Farm. The leading role is taken by the pigs, portrayed as the most intelligent of the animals, and after the success of the revolution a power-struggle breaks out between two of their number, Napoleon and Snowball. With the aid of a trained pack of dogs, Napoleon banishes Snowball from the farm and makes himself a barnyard dictator. From then on, the farm is run in the interests of Napoleon and the pigs. One by one, the principles of Animalism are abandoned and the other animals are treated as badly by the pigs as they were by Jones.Orwell intended the book as a satirical allegory of the Russian Revolution and of the way in which Communism had developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin. Major personifies Marx, Snowball Trotsky, Napoleon Stalin and Jones the Tsar. Other animals on the farm stand not for individual historical figures but for types- for example the simple-minded but strong and good-hearted horse Boxer stands for that section of the Soviet working class which continued to support Communism wholeheartedly even during the Stalinist era. The dogs represent the security apparatus of the Red Army and NKVD, the pig Squealer the propaganda system, the mare Mollie who deserts Animal Farm the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; community, and so on. The allegory is somewhat simplified- there is, for example, no character precisely equivalent to Lenin- but most of the main developments in Soviet history have their equivalents in the book- the revolution, the Stalin-Trotsky split, the Five Year Plans (symbolised by the building of a windmill), the purges, the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the German invasion of 1941.Orwell wrote the book in the winter of 1943/44, at the height of the Second World War. To criticise Russia in Britain at this point in history took courage, as there was a consensus on both Left and Right of the political spectrum that Stalin was our gallant ally; many on the Left still clung to the illusion that the Soviet Union was a utopian workers' paradise, while the Right regarded criticism of a British ally during wartime as unpatriotic. Orwell himself was politically on the Left, but he had become disillusioned not only with Stalinism but also with what he called ""violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people""; such a revolution could only lead to the people exchanging one despotism for another.Orwell not only satirised the history of the Soviet Union up to 1943, he also used the book in order to predict the way in which the Soviet system might develop in future. He correctly predicted that the Soviets would defeat Nazi Germany (represented by the vicious farmer Frederick). The book ends with the pigs becoming indistinguishable from the humans who still run the other farms in the district; this can be taken as a prediction that Stalinist Communism would inevitably end by reverting to a capitalist system indistinguishable from that prevailing in the West. When he wrote ""1984"" a few years later, however, he seems to have changed this view, because the system over which Big Brother presides is not capitalism but what Orwell called ""Oligarchical Collectivism"". Although Orwell continued to believe in democratic Socialism, it seems that by the time ""1984""was published he no longer believed that Socialism and democracy were indivisible, but rather that it was possible to sustain a totalitarian system in which property would nominally be owned collectively but would be controlled in the interests of an elite group of Party leaders.A few years after Orwell's death, ""Animal Farm"" was made into a cartoon. Although the film was a success, it was criticised for reversing Orwell's ending by having the other animals rise up against their pig masters. During the Cold War, an implied prediction that Soviet Communism would ultimately be overthrown was obviously a popular message in the West. So who was right, Orwell or the film-makers? In a way, both were. As far as post-Stalin Russia was concerned, the film-makers appear to have got it right. The Soviet Union and its satellites never re-introduced Western-style capitalism, but remained collectivist oligarchies until the system collapsed in the late eighties and early nineties. As for the other Communist superpower, however, Orwell's prediction was spot-on, even though Mao's regime did not exist when ""Animal Farm"" was written. In recent years China has transformed itself from a Marxist dictatorship into a capitalist one without a revolution or even a change in the name of the ruling party.Orwell himself described the book as ""a fairy story"". It is very brief, a novella rather than a novel, and is told in a deceptively simple style. It can, in fact, be enjoyed by children who know little or nothing about Russian history, but it is clearly more than a children's story about animals. It is, in fact, in my view, the most devastating piece of political satire in twentieth-century English literature. By showing that even the most brutal dictatorships have something ridiculous about their pretensions, Orwell did for Stalin what Charlie Chaplin did for Hitler. Since ""Animal Farm"" it has no longer been possible to see Stalin as a heroic revolutionary leader, or even as a grandiose figure of heroic evil, like Milton's Satan. He was simply the biggest pig in the barnyard."

I have to agree with the negative reviewers of this book, Mr. Allens challenge to make $24,000 in 24 hours was scamful (is that a word?). Considering the fact that he was already a well known author and real-estate goo rue. This ploy was only a great publicity stunt, not so different from P.T. Barnum and others who have attained a high level of success. It's true, Mr. Allen did pander his web-site as well as all of his books and tape sets in excess, and this would scare some thin-skinned readers away. Now for the good stuff: whether this information is outdated or not, the internet is where it's at. Much of his book was authored by people who had gone from simple ideas to making millions of dollars online. With constantly growing traffic and all the garbage on the net there's never a better time than now to do it! Robert Allen pulls no punches and lets the reader know this business takes a lot of work and research. It is neither stated or implied that this is a get-rich-quick scheme. Roberts writing style is impeccable, especially for a writer of how-to books. This book seemed more like a suspense novel. I loved it and highly recommend it."

It causes one to focus on the Christ in Christianity and presses the point that the focus should not be on one's goodness or the social values of the world, after one reasonably looks and considers the case for Christianity they will realize that it is true and real and that Christ might be trusted and that the sphere of religion isn't where my focus should be but that of Christ.A must read!

0316011282,Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies),,A3EUS4JC68Q476,Miss Print,3/3,5.0,1189296000,from [...],"I had the chance to talk to Justina Chen Headley briefly before she gave a reading from Nothing But the Truth (and a Few White Lies). She was very cool, grounded and an absolute pleasure to talk to. So, it should be no surprise that her narrator, Patty Ho, is equally enjoyable in every way in Headley's first novel written for young adults.Half-Taiwanese and half-white, Patty feels like she doesn't belong anywhere. This fact is confirmed when, instead of going to the last school dance of the year, Patty's mother drags her to a fortune teller who discerns Patty's future from her belly button. Things get worse from there when Patty realizes that sometimes dream guys are anything but and finds herself enrolled in Stanford math camp for the summer.This novel is a classic coming-of-age story. As the plot progresses, Patty learns that sometimes you have to find people like you in order to appreciate the value of being really unique. Now, that might sound a bit pat and cliche--but I can assure you this book is anything but.Headley writes with a style unlike any authors I've read recently. The narration is snappy and spunky--as is fitting for a teenage girl as vibrant as Patty. I also like that Headley doesn't take the easy way a lot of the time. The story doesn't follow any typical girl-meets-boy formula. In fact, Headley has quite a few twists thrown in along the way.It's also really interesting to read about Patty and her mother. The subject doesn't often come up in teen literature, where often the characters are immigrants if they are not white. Headley's dialog between Patty and her mother seems realistic (not being Taiwanese at all I can't really say). Her incorporation of slang and certain speech mannerisms bring to mind Amy Tan's writing in The Hundred Secret Senses (another book about a half-asian, half-white character, incidentally). Honestly though, everything in the book is interesting. Even math camp, which some readers will view as warily as Patty does in the beginning, turns out to be a cool environment to read about (with minimal time spent on math in the narrative).In a lot of reviews you'll see me complaining that the characters come off as flat. Happily, I can say that is not the case here. Patty and her myriad friends (and enemies too) jump off the page. Furthermore, Headley artfully negotiates Patty's changing sense of self throughout the novel.It's weird to be saying this about a novel that isn't a thriller, but it was really a page turner. I couldn't put it down. Headley has a lot to say here about identity and family and self-confidence. All of which she manages like a pro.The term ""new classic"" is bandied about a lot for modern books and movies. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Nothing But the Truth is going to get that label if it doesn't have it already."

It has been my opinion that this is a book written in a harmonic that resonates in understanding at a level above the concrete mind and should be read through even if not completely understood at the moment of reading.I have had others verbally express the same opinion as above to me without my input. In my opinion this is a book that will keep coming back at you for a very long time.Of the hundreds of books of similar orientation that I have read, I consider this one book to be the most Lucid! Of the approximately 1300 pages, the first 6 to 7 hundred addressing the creation of reality through mind, may change the way you participate with life!As Buckeroo Banzai said, &quot; No matter where you go, there you are!&quot;Also worth reading (though not at the level of the above, but still superb!)

B000MOOAJG,Atlas Shrugged,,A3EURTKV2HTYJ6,"Prohobo ""Reason...""",1/3,3.0,1338336000,Important book - but needs editing.,"Undoubtedly if you are reading this review you probably know the story: Government expands, becomes Socialist, nationalizes industry, pretty much takes over. The innovators, inventors, business leaders start to disappear and at the center of this mystery is someone named John Galt.The story and characters are actually very good and in many respects relevant today,in our nation and abroad. Socialism becomes popular in faltering economies - just look around.So is the story worth the read? That's a hard one to answer for several reasons:1. IMHO it should be edited. It is far to long and long-winded. Too bad, because it is an excellent story.2. Unlike her other books - it is spends too much time force feeding the ideological battle with long winded dialogue. The first half of the book is excellent 5 stars and the second half is 2 stars - the 50 page speech is just too long. I think she loses the significance and impact - because it drags on too long.3. This is just my personal opinion - which is why we give reviews - I am just not a fan of her writing style and I think that majority of people that agree with her philosophy have gotten over her style of writing. I think Fountainhead is a far better read, as far as writing and editing - however even though this is a fiction, one should think of it as a philosophical book in many respects. I just wish I enjoyed her writing style more.4. It is a pivotal book in our political/economic history - for that alone it should be read and hopefully objectively (no pun intended). Regardless of my opinions and criticisms - it is an important book and certainly brings to light many issues and will certainly bring much needed dialogue and debate to the table - for that alone it is worth reading (by all ideological beliefs).I really want to love the book, because I love to story and generally agree with her libertian views. Note I said generally (I am not a devote follower). However - I could only wish it was edited and the characters giving a little more meat. On one hand I appreciate it is fiction, so for me it should entertain (which just misses the mark - for me) - on the other hand, I understand that this is her magnum opus in which she wants to clearly bring home her message (which she does in spades).To break down my review:5 stars for the story.3 stars for the heavy handed message.1 star for the editing.May I suggest a book that ""supposedly"" influenced her and stole some of the story for Atlas Shrugged, ""The Driver"" by Garet GarrettThe Driver. It is sold on Amazon, but you can also find free PDF editions on the web. It was written by a journalist in the 1930s and is very similar in message and theme - but very short."
B0006SHMPC,The Discovery of King Arthur,,A2UNZU69OZRRJX,"Nelson R. Willis ""Rob Willis""",32/32,5.0,908064000,The most brilliant and important thesis on this subject.,"I've read this book 5 times now, and it still impresses and amazes me. To be perfectly honest, I did not realize its brilliance and importance until the second time I read it. When this book was first published in the mid 80s, I was already a fan of Ashe, having read other books by him about reconstructing a historical Arthur figure and culture. The first time I read it, I thought that it was weak and conflicted with theories put forth by him in his previous books -- theories which I felt were fine and did not need to be improved on. A couple of years ago, someone convinced me to read it a second time, and it absolutely blew my mind! So I recomend that anyone who is not impressed with it give it another chance. Yes, it shifts Arthur chronologically back a generation or so, but many Arthurian events are being shifted back several years in light of the most up-to-date scholoarship. What Ashe does is he lines up the legend of Arthur, as told by Geoffrey of Monmouth, side by side with the history of the fifth century British king, Riothamus, and points out not just a few, but a whole slew of parallels. There are many theories out there trying to reconstruct a historical King Arthur (e.g. see my review of _King Arthur: The True Story_ by Graham Phillips and Martin Keatman), many of which try to identify Arthur with someone on record under a different name; most such theories are weak at best and often quite preposterous, being based on the vaguest scraps of evidence and the most tenuous conicidences. Ashe's theory, on the other hand, is a startlingly strong case made up of a preponderance of circumstantial evidence; one may point to any one thing and say that it is only a coincidence, but when you get layer upon layer of these and couple it with archaeological evidence, one can no longer dismiss the similarities between Riothamus and Arthur as mere coincidence. Take it from a guy who has read a lot of books and articles on this subject: this is not just another among the myriad of historical Arthur theories; this deserves to be far and away the preeminent reconstruction of a historical Arthur. Ashe is a genius!"
B000OU8DMS,THE BLACK ECHO.,,A16QQ78I8J29PA,Thriller Lover,2/2,4.0,1152057600,The Debut of Harry Bosch,"This is Michael Connelly's first book. It features Harry Bosch, the LAPD Homicide Detective that Connelly has featured in over 10 books. This debut, first published in 1992, was widely acclaimed and won Connelly an Edgar award for best first novel.Since writing this book, Connelly has dramatically risen in popularity and many people consider him to be the best American crime fiction writer working today. I've read 8 of his books, and I personally think that it's true: he is the best, or at least one of the best.That being said, this is probably my least favorite book by Connelly. Don't get me wrong -- like all of Connelly's books, this book is well written and well plotted. In my opinion, however, the book is too long and really sags in the middle. I found myself skipping through pages, hoping for something to happen. There is also a romantic subplot in the book that isn't particularly believable or necessary to the story. I also found the resolution of the story to be completely unbelievable, and too dependent on a remarkable series of coincidences.I strongly preferred the two subsequent books in this series, THE BLACK ICE, and especially the CONCRETE BLONDE, which I found very well paced and exciting. It was THE CONCRETE BLONDE that made me a Bosch fan, not this book."

First, however, I am opposed to Professor Pinn's view that the word ""religion"" should be part of the nomenclature of black humanism or black non-theism. Professor Pinn hinges his argument on the original meaning of the word religion which means: to link, to bind, to connect. And one can connect to anything, people, places or things.Thus, as a word, religion"" has no specific connection to theism per-say. He also points out that because ""humanism function[s] as a religious system within African American communities"", ""religion"" should be used as part of the name. He argues that the word should be reclaimed from the theistic world.Indeed, the word ""religion"" is in no way connected to theism, but because it has been co-opted by the theistic world, ""religion"", as a word, is contaminated with centuries of theistic baggage that makes it an obstacle to humanism and non-theism.However, despite my disagreement with Professor Pinn on this nomenclature issue, I, as an Afro-Caribbean, non-theistic humanist, strongly endorses this book. Professor Pinn has shown light on an aspect of the black liberation struggle that has been neglected by almost all black authors writing on black peoples struggle for dignity, power and justice. By These Hands has peeled back the cover that, for years, has prevented many of us from recognizing the fact that it was not only the theistic religions that contributed to the black liberation struggle. It shows that many regular and intellectual African Americans has, from the beginning, embraced a non-theistic and humanistic approach to improving their conditions. By These Hands has exposed as myth the idea that all slaves were obedient lambs who obediently rolled over and accepted the slave masters' religion.In one essay entitle, Experiences of a Chimney Sweeper, for instance, we are introduced to John Junior. A man who denounced the commonly held position that says if you put your burdens in Christ/God, all will be taken care of. To John, he recognized that his condition could only have been changed by him becoming the doer/active agent. In other words;By his own hands, and not through prayer. The Black abolitionist, Fredrick Douglass, expresses it this way, ""I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs"". Douglas, of course, was talking about his eventual escape from slavery.By These Hands has brought to light the deep historical roots and influence humanism and non-theism have had in shaping the struggle for liberation. This book is an excellent book that should be read by all who are interested in an often overlooked dimension of Black history. It is a must read for the black population."

Their homes, their meals, their weddings, their life style in general. And I am in awe of her ability to blend with her extended family and yet still keep her individuality.

1570629102,"Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism (World of Tibetan Buddhism, Vol. 1)",16.2,A1SRZE1C77PP20,JMM,0/0,5.0,1284940800,A Thorough Introduction to Tibetan Buddhist Religious Thought from Both an Insider and Outsider Viewpoint,"This is the first volume in Reginald Ray's two-volume introduction to Tibetan Buddhism. It focuses on the more conventional aspects of the tradition while the second volume (Secret of the Vajra World) deals with the more esoteric tantric components. Ray begins with a description of Buddhist Cosmology and he explains how Tibetans view that cosmology and integrate it into their daily lives. This helps to eliminate some of the dry scholasticism so often found in various introductions to religions. The fact that Ray has been a Buddhist practitioner for many years as well as a Western academic allows him approach the subject sometimes as an insider, a Buddhist who has participated in rituals and meditated on teachings, and sometimes as an outsider, a professor who can describe Tibetan history and Buddhist teachings in the more conventional academic way. I found this approach to be very effective, and Ray is able to maintain a balance somewhere between writing a love letter to his personal religious tradition and writing about Tibetan Buddhism as though it were a mysterious phenomenon from an alien world.I thought this book was organized very well. After the introduction on cosmology, it begins with a section on the history of the spread of Buddhism to Tibet, including a short discussion of the forms of Buddhism in India during the times leading up to both the early and later transmissions of Buddhism to Tibet. There are sections on the various ""schools"" of Tibetan Buddhism, the Nyingma, Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu, Gelug, as well as a section on the Ri-me (nonsectarian) movement of the 19th century. Ray stresses two trajectories within Tibetan Buddhist practice, scholarly monastic traditions and non-monastic tantric lineages, and compares the emphasis on each within each of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. In fact, this dichotomy undergirds his entire discussion of Buddhist history.The next section contains a detailed discussion of the view and practice of Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism, respectively. Ray describes the view that is cultivated in each of the vehicles and then describes how that view influences one's meditation and ethical activities. It is important to note that Ray emphasizes that this division is merely a didactic convention and that, within Tibetan Buddhism, ""Hinayana"" does not necessarily refer to ""Theravada"" Buddhism. The final section introduces the gradual development of Buddhist philosophy by using the traditional framework of the ""Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma."" These three turnings are the Abhidharma system, Madhyamaka philosophy, and teachings on the Buddha-nature. This is likely the most difficult section of the book for those relatively unfamiliar with Buddhism, but Ray does an admirable job succinctly presenting the tenets of each system. He also briefly summarizes the debate among some Tibetan schools as to whether the second or third turning constitutes the final, ultimate teaching of the Buddha.Again, this book is a comprehensive introduction to Tibetan religious thought, both its history and practice. It does not focus so much on Tibetan culture, but that is not its aim. Whether you want to learn about Tibetan Buddhism from scratch or wish to augment what you already know, I highly recommend this book. Perhaps the best praise I can give is that I plan to read the companion volume, Secret of the Vajra World, another 400+ page book, very soon."

I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It is a great way to start discovering Oscar Wilde's workthrough this book full of mystery, which still asks today this valid question: ""What are peoplewilling to sell to get eternal beauty?"""

0449233413,Dragonwyck,,AC9B29BXXWJHD,K. Huff,16/17,4.0,1147996800,Sinister,"The premise of Dragonwick seems very much like that of Jane Eyre--a young woman goes tot he house of a very wealthy man to teac his child and ends up falling in love with him. However, this book adds a completely new dimension to this story outline. The main character is absolutely nothing like the demure, humble Jane, and everyone else is sinister in a way that Charlotte Bronte's characters never could have been.The book begins in 1844 and ends in 1849, covering the land rent problems the landlords face, the Astor Place Massacre, and the far-away wars in Texas. The Mid-Atlantic is peopled solely with those of old Dutch ancestry, and cattle still live in downtown Manhattan, which is more farmland than city real estate in the mid-19th century.Miranda Welles is the daughter of a poor farmer from Connecticuit. One day the family recieves a letter from a wealthy New York cousin of theirs, the Van Ryns. Nicholas Van Ryn, looking for a governess for his six-year-old daughter, asks the Welles family if they might be able to spare one of their daughters for the task. And so Miranda goes to New York, a place much finer than she had ever expected it to be. Van Ryn is of old Dutch stock that came to America two hundred years before, and are landlords and adherents to the old way of living, a way that is quickly disintegrating.Upon arriving at the family estate, Dragonwyck, Miranda meets the Lady of the House, the corpulent Johanna. It is clear that Nicholas is no longer in love with his wife, and his attentions turn toward Miranda, who is his cousin by marriage. The book has an omniscient narrator, with intervals in which various minor characters interject their thoughts and feelings (the French Count's are the funniest and most astute). Vvery quickly, Miranda notices something discomfitting about the house, despite its beauty. All the members of the blood line of the Van Ryn family can hear the ghostly cries of one of their ancestors, and Miranda can feel that ancestor's presence in several areas of the house.Upon Johanna Van Ryn's death, under suspicious circumstances, Nicholas immediately proposes to Miranda, though they must wait a year to allow for mourning. Nicholas comes back to her exactly as promised, and they marry. But there is something not quite right with their marriage; Nicholas has a tendency to turn away from distressing situations--or he faces them and does something foolish. It is clear that Nicholas's moments of tenderness towards his new wife become few and far between.Added into the mix is a country doctor, Jefferson Turner. A local man who supports those who are trying to overthrow the manorial system, Jeff has an intense dislike, yet an admiration for Van Ryn. He also develops feelings towards Miranda, who increase as the book progresses.Oone thing that I liked about the book was the number of contemporary authors who had cameos. We meet, briefly, Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. By the way, it is from the latter that Nicholas acquires a foul habit that will affect him significantly later on in the book. In sum, I thought this was a wonderful book, though not on the same level as Katherine and Green Ddrakness. Nevertheless, its not difficult to see why Seton's books are being reprinted; they're truly wonderful novels in the gothic style."

Spinoza),"In this book, Karl Popper explains his vision on the course of history, on historical determinism, and on the theories of Descartes, Poincar&eacute; and Duhem.The course of historyFor K. Popper, evolution in history is never dominated by theories, although they may exert some influence, at the same time many other less rational or even completely irrational factors are at work.Historicism (Engels, Marx, Spencer, J.S. Mill, K. Mannheim)Historicism is that part of social sciences which considers historical predictions as its main objective. It pretends that this goal can be achieved if we discover the 'laws' or 'trends' that underlie historical developments.Karl Popper rejects this approach for the following reasons: the course of human history depends heavily on the increase of human knowledge. We can not rationally or scientifically predict this increase. So, we can not determine the future course of history. Developing a theoretical history which is the equivalent of theoretical physics, is impossible.Descartes, Poincar&eacute;, Duhem, essentialismFor Descartes, the principles and premises of deductive systems must be certain ('clear and distinct'). For K. Popper, these principles are only provisory, are only hypotheses. Popper does not agree either with Poincar&eacute; and Duhem, for which some systems may not be subjected to empirical tests. A world of universals (essentialism) doesn't exist, only a world of real objects (nominalism).Popper's proposition of piecemeal adjustments (not revolutions) in the social sphere has been heavily criticized. One critic even asked how a HIV plague can be attacked by piecemeal interventions. But, in fact, the HIV plague was attacked in a piecemeal manner; first by individual drugs, then by cocktails.This defense of indeterminism is a must for all historians and for all Popper fans.The best introduction to Popper's philosophy is Bryan Magee's `Philosophy and the Real World. An Introduction to Karl Popper'."

0939495864,A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man,,A2YXRT2XIJIO57,John P. Jones III,1/1,5.0,1345161600,"""Welcome, O Life!""...","So concludes James Joyce, with the subject quote, in this Irish coming-of-age novel. I first read this novel a few decades ago, and felt it deserved a re-read, in particular, to contrast it with other novels in this genre. Most recently, I've read the Norwegian novelist, Per Petterson'sIt's Fine By Me. There is also the classic French workLe grand Meaulnes., and, for better or worse, the AmericanThe Catcher in the Rye. In terms of Joyce, I'd also read his stream-of-consciousness masterpieceUlysses. A re-read of that should await at least a first reading ofThe Dubliners, if notFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin).In approaching this novel, the ""reference frame"" of the reader will be a dominant consideration: practicing Catholic, or, ex-Catholic, or, never-once-was a Catholic. Because, unlike the other three coming-of-age novels mentioned above, religious dogma, in the form of Catholic beliefs, permeates this work. Naturally, the anticipation, and reality of sex makes more than a cameo appearance. There are the shifting relationships with parents and adults as one moves toward become their coeval (Stephan visits his father' childhood home of Cork, with him, and his father treats him more as a brother). And there are the forms, and reality of obtaining an education, dominated by the schools and professional educators.Stephan Dedalus is the character that largely serves as James Joyce's alter-ego. The novel commences in his infancy, with a nursery rhyme meant to instill fear, and therefore obedience: ""Or, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes."" A fitting prelude to the religious dogma that promotes so much of the same. The next section depicts boarding school scenes, the austerity and coldness of life, the spectrum of teachers who seek to guide, influence, or impose their will on the children. I thought the Christmas holiday scene, when Stephan is first at home, especially apt, since it illustrated the sharp gender division related to the Catholic Church, unsurprising, perhaps, to anyone who has attended one of their services, particularly in Europe. In a later scene, Dedalus is wrongly punished by a rector. The young lad, despite possible dire consequences, reports the rector to his superior, and enjoys a modest triumph of righteousness.For me, the climactic scene occurred half-way through the novel. At the age of 16, Stephan succumbs to the temptations of the flesh, on a commercial basis, and then is immediately tormented with his ""mortal sin,"" and the ever-so-graphic depictions of eternal torment that are promoted by Church officials. The only ""salvation"" is confession, and he must muster the courage to tell a complete stranger what an abysmal sinner he is. As an ex-Catholic, this sequence of events resonated, as did terms I had not thought about in a long time, like the difference between ""actual"" and ""sanctifying"" grace. Stephan's burden of eternal damnation is, at least temporarily, removed, and he does so well in his true contrition, (contrition that transcends mere fear of eternal damnation) that he is approached by one of the priests in order to discuss the possibility that he has a priestly vocation (yes, the ""join the brotherhood"" pitch).But a scene of a young woman, gazing out to sea, with comely legs, deters Dedalus from thoughts of permanent abstention. In a passage that anticipates another famous one fromUlysses, Joyce writes: ""Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on and on and on!""I'll give Joyce a hearty amen, from the amen corner. 5-stars."

Australopithecus,1/1,5.0,1149638400,"Never mind the bollocks, buy this book!","For many years, I have been taking the Best American Poetry books down from the shelf at the local bookstore for a peek, but I never felt compelled to buy one until I read the 2002 version selected by Robert Creeley. I've always had more respect than affection for Creeley, finding it hard to get into his stuff, but I loved the synergy (Marketing stole this word from the Greeks--I'm stealing it back) produced by the juxtaposition of devil-may-care experimentation with the best of more traditional, ""mainstream"" offerings in this volume. My favorite examples of these divergent impulses here are Jenny Boully's ""The Body,"" a poem in the form of footnotes to blank pages (this poem has been ridiculed in other reviews found here, but I find it daring and exhilirating--in fact, I wish I had thought of it first) and Donald Hall's ""Affirmation,"" an astonishingly straightforward and devastating poem that is one of my favorites from his body of work and one that should warm (freeze?) the heart of the most esthetically conservative reader.Even though I received a B.A. in English with a focus on creative writing ten years ago, I have only recently begun to understand the struggle between those who would keep poetry at a place it never was (the ""School of Quietude"" in Ron Silliman's terms--you MUST read his blog, it's good whether you agree or not, just as long as you care about poetry) and those who want poetry to continue to evolve (not ""improve""), no matter what unexpected and scary turns it may take (what Mr Silliman calls, in our time, the ""post-avant""). This book seems to have frightened most of the reviewers who felt compelled to contribute their opinions here, which frightened state they express as distaste. Just know that the most innovative and forward poetry that has lasted was seen in its time as ""eccentric"" or ""inaccessible"" or ""repugnant"" or ""unreadable"" or ""incomprehensible,"" ad nauseam, from Euripides to T.S. Eliot, who, despite of his conversion to stultifying artistic conservatism and his weird adoption by ""the Establishment"" (and weirder disinheritance by ""the anti-Establishment""), told us, if I remember correctly, that meaning should not be sought when first reading poetry that is new to us, but rather an understanding of the qualities of language the poet is presenting to us.[This may be a complete misrepresentation of Eliot; I'm sorry I don't remember where I read his statement about reading for meaning. Anyway, people who hate this book will respond that there is no quality to the language here, the good old days were the best, blah blah blah etc etc, but this is as good a place as any to end this review.]"

Wuthering Heights breeds initself a &quot;horror of darkness&quot;, we sometimes breathe in our lives. The love existing between Heathcliff- the most loved villians of all time and Catherine stands strong. This book is about a stranger entering a household where he is rejected, and during this course betrays the one solitary feling in his heart- not being his love for Catherine, but compassion. The other half of the story reaches a point where Heathcliff takes his sweet revenge. There are no answers to questions like: Should a character like Heathcliff exist or not? I do not know. This is a masterpiece in literature depicting love, innocence lost, friendship, forgiveness and above all acceptance. Unfortunately, this was the first and last book of Emily Bronte.

The majority of human life has been destroyed by nuclear warfare before the narrative begins. Only people living in the farthest reaches of the the southern hemisphere remain alive. They too will all be dead in a matter of months as the unstoppable cloud of deadly radiation ultimately covers the entire planet.The novel features a number of Australian characters as well as an American submarine captain. As doomsday approaches, their lives are touchingly described. On the Beach contains some interesting scenarios and there are many moments of poignancy especially in the final pages.Much of the narrative contains accounts of everyday life as the characters strive to go about their business as if the end weren't just around the corner. Since everyday life isn't all that exciting, these portions of the book may be seen as rather dull. It's just very hard to write about the mundaneness of day to day existence without being a little bit boring.All in all, an interesting and thought provoking take on the doomsday novel.

The primary reason I'm writing this review is because I don't think the other reviewers have given a completely accurate view of the book. I've just finished the book and have very mixed feelings about it which I don't think the other reviewers give justice.My first and biggest argument with the book is that it is completely based on the mankind-exploits-everything viewpoint. A quick look at our collective history does not disagree with that viewpoint, but a more detailed look at history does. Mankind has been evolving as a social critter at a fantastic rate for the last 600 years or so. Things that came naturally in the Dark and Middle Ages in Europe such as witch-burning and stoning people to death are now viewed with total revulsion. Cynics (pragmatists?) will argue that these barbaric methods of repression have been replaced by more effective forms of repression. I'd like to think that they are not looking at the long term history of humanity.This book, on the other hand, covers the long term very nicely , 17,000+ years of human history running from the near future to the total extermination of humanity by tens of thousands of enraged alien races. The 26 short stories that cover this era give you plenty to think about regarding the human race. Every possible human virtue and sin is in full display here as humanity strives to achieve total domination of the galaxy and then fritters away every last advantage in wanton stupidity and cruelty when we finally succeed. I'm not saying that it isn't reasonable, I'm just saying that I'd like to think that some faction of humanity would survive, that ever-adaptable humanity would find some way to avoid getting totally exterminated.My other major problem is that the stories are only loosely linked together. We get to meet hundreds of individuals, know them briefly, and then never see them again. This is a natural result of trying to tell 26 very different stores in about 300 pages but the result feels like reading an encyclopedia by reading one paragraph of one entry per letter of the alphabet. You are left with the feeling that there is an extraordinary amount of interesting material all around you that you are never going to be allowed to see. Very frustrating for me personally.If you feel that I'm trashing the book, please consider the fact that I gave it 3 stars. All I'm saying is that this is not a book that can or should be consumed in one sitting and don't be surprised if you have some very strong emotions when you are done."

But once I read the first few pages I was hooked. The book is based on Oscar Wilde's play of the same name, one I only vaguely had heard of. Although the story takes place in 19th century England, the humor transcends time. It starts off when one gentleman meets up with another. Questions arise to the identity of the visiting man, named Ernest, which leads to a mini-mystery. The two men banter humorously throughout the book accompanied by the leading ladies and a very accomodating butler. The reason for the title becomes apparent when the name Ernest is the central cause for the hilarity. I absolutely loved this book! It was a quick read and made me laugh out loud. I was surprised that noone else had written a review for it. I was glad I took a chance with something that, on the surface, didn't look very appealing. You won't be disappointed if you did, too."

B0007H4QBK,Economics in one lesson,,A1VA170GUYGTB,Paula L. Craig,6/9,4.0,1090022400,Good But Some Holes,"Henry Hazlitt's book starts with a single lesson-that economics means looking beyond the immediate effects of any act or policy to the consequences of it for everyone. The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great. I wish it were better known. His examples vary in quality. Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946. The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever. The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common. In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes. The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized. Oil companies and the like don't have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow. Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing. Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely. Given that GNP doesn't include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable. Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. I tend to agree. Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way. Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies. Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt."

0271010010,Southern Baptist Politics,55.95,ABGYWSK3MBAN,George Hillst,0/0,3.0,1308700800,Southern Baptist Politics,"The author of this book is a sociologist and this book is intended to be a sociological piece of work. Not being in any way skilled in sociology I can not comment on Farnsley's argument in this regard. Nonetheless, this book aims to draw out the sociological conclusions from the midst of a carefully crafted historical narrative and as is therefore equally as useful as an outsider's introduction to recent Southern Baptist history. The reason for my interest in this book is because I am a keen admirer of the historical Baptist polity (eg. Smyth and Helwys) but strongly dislike contemporary (official) Southern Baptist theology/ethics. I was keen therefore to try to understand in what sense Southern Baptists are ""Baptist"" in the historical sense.This book shows that the answer that the answer is, ""not very much"". Key facts like the revisionist interpretation of the idea of the Priesthood of all believers and the effective oligarchic centralisation of decision-making make we wonder how the SBC can in any way be labelled a Baptist denomination.One of the interesting points in Southern Baptist Politics is how he shows that the Fundamentalist usurption of power merely relied and copied the methods used by the moderates to keep out the fundamentalists previously. On one hand it is easy to demonise the fundamentalists for their actions but they exhibit a willingless to manipulate their political power and develop consensus by excluding dissident opinions (rather than by together seeking the mind of God with all parties - as is the historic Baptist way (in theory at least) -.After giving a narrative of the Fundamentalist takeover of the SBC gives an overview of key areas of interest such as the way the moderates have reacted which is usually by fielding biblical inerrantists themselves, the nature of authority, the role of local churches in the convention and the influence of southern culture. Overall this book was an interesting read that will be useful for those wishing to understand the mentality of the SBC."
B0007DRGI4,To kill a mockingbird,,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,D. Mok,0/0,5.0,927763200,"Untouchable in stature, intimate in its approach.","Superlatives no longer mean much to this venerable classic, one of the best novels ever written. So I'm more interested in describing what makes the book work.Humour is one crucial factor. By never succumbing to the pretentious grandiosity that has plagued many a novelist since the form's rise to prominence in the Victoria era, To Kill a Mockingbird achieves an endearing relationship with its reader. Every character is vivid, with strengths and faults, and Lee achieves that difficult amalgam in first-person narratives presented as recollections: A mixture of an adult's rhetorical power and a child's keen, curious eye. The language is fresh and unburdened by the moralizing which frequently cripples prose narrative (especially books which deal with sensitive issues as this one does).Lee made a perfect choice in personalizing a socio-political issue. To Kill a Mockingbird is predominantly the coming-of-age story of Jem and Scout Finch, and the themes of racism, injustice, conservatism and the Depression are all the better served this way. Issues do not come alive except through the living, breathing experience of their participants and Scout Finch's particular take on the events of this book only makes those events gain in moral strength, not diminish.Boo Radley, Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem, Miss Maudie...the characters of this book have achieved an iconic status rare in modern literature. And it has achieved this not by making them Nietzschean uebermenschen, but by entering into their lives with fair, enthusiastic frankness. And to end off, this is one of only a handful of truly successful negotiations between the dramatic (eg. theatre, screenwriting) and the narrative (eg. prose narrative, filmmaking, folk storysongs) I can think of. Lee's dialogue is sharp enough, and immediate enough, that even if we pared this book down to just its dialogue and situations, we'd end up with a remarkably powerful play. As it stands now, it's a truly successful crossover, its dramatic situations and character interactions every bit as convincing as the engrossing power of its storytelling.I am all for challenging the canons of all artistic forms, but this one is about as close to perfect as I've seen a novel come, ranking right up there with the greatest of the greats. It has its weak chinks -- Atticus' misunderstanding of Heck Tate's point in the second-last chapter is befuddling, for example, but these are so minute that to dwell on them would be overkill. Thematically worthy to be called an American epic, this book never forgets the personal in light of the social. We should be grateful it was ever written."

B000876BZI,History of Virginia: A brief textbook for schools,,A3RF50DD2MY5M6,Jim Nicholas,1/1,4.0,1124150400,Personal Review,"I believe this textbook was used by a grandmother, probably on my brother's side (He had a different father), and has ""Germantown Graded School, 1910"" hand written in the front.While it is generally well written, it is written in a more formal style no longer in use. What I find fascinating about the book is the perspective held during that time (1898 publication date) on matters that were, close to them, and far from us.Most interesting, was the discussion of the political view of the Union, of which the idea being that it was ""a series of compromises, not entirely satisfactory to any one."" The book holds forth the basis of what vexes us still to this day, state's rights vs. Federal authority. Until the Civil War, this was a heated political debate, probably much like abortion and other issues are today.Thus, one theory held that the States gave limited powers to a Federal government and reserved the right to leave if so desired and thus the U.S. was a ""league"" of nation states.The other was that upon signing the Constitution a State had surrendered their statehood to form a nation.Which one was true? Well, this little war we refer to as the Civil War was essentially over that question. And, because of this, in U.S. History classes today, you will learn of mostly one point of view. That is one of the reasons why I believe this is an interesting book. It also has a nice color map of Virginia, which was probably an unique item in 1898. Also, being that it the last section is from the Civil War to the present (1898), then it is also a fairly short book."

1857022106,Race of Angels: The Genesis of U2,,AUEY946M1L939,"John L Murphy ""Fionnch""",1/2,3.0,1258848000,Certainly not your usual band bio,"An intellectual's heap of his highbrow reading, interviews with three of the band (where's Larry?), and big ideas on Irish identity in an alienated, globalized pop culture. It's a book that must have, when it came out in 1994 after ""Zooropa"" have bewildered fans wanting another tell-all lightweight read about their idols.I confess to a weakness for big ideas on Irish and musical and intellectual concepts. So, their combination here intrigued me. Waters, later known more for his socio-political journalism (and for his custody battle with Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor over their son), brings his energy to the page. Looking back on this after 15 years, it may have worked better in the blog form not yet invented. It skips from a workmanlike term-paper feel citing Guy Debord and Jacques Attali, Daniel Corkery and Umberto Eco, Richard Kearney and Franz Fanon (source of the title, and if some or all of these names are obscure, it's indicative of the rarified audience for this work) to a chapter suddenly extolling the origins of ""One Tree Hill."" There's no chronological account of the band's formation or their discography; it starts rapturously recounting a Toronto Zoo TV concert that on the page left me nonplussed.Waters may be at his best eking out connections between his own thinking and the band's own explanations of how they responded to the British punk movement as music meant ""for,"" rather than ""to"" or ""about"" themselves. Waters labors to insist that the Irish punks out of which U2 formed their concepts, necessarily distanced from the rebellious stances more easily assumed by the masters in England rather than their colonized subjects in Ireland, could not have aped Johnny Rotten exactly. (It's a shame this came out the same year as John Lydon's ""Rotten: No Blacks, No Dogs, No Irish"" as Waters' case might have been severely altered if he'd been able to read Rotten; he also skimps over Shane MacGowan's bicultural upbringing.)He compares Fanon's three-stage trajectory out of colonial subjection to a provocative defense of the much-derided showbands of the 1950s-60s, and of the often also unfairly derided Horslips of the 1970s, as cultural predecessors for the breakthrough that U2 found itself able to make in late '70s-early '80s Ireland. Waters wonders if in Ireland, with its 70 million abroad claiming a share of the oul' sod's bloodlines, if its World Cup team's makeup might be more representative of the true lineage of today's nation. He finds in its ""human incontinence,"" the way Ireland has dribbled away to other lands its best brains and deepest talent, however, a cautionary reminder of how it squanders its energy and heritage.He cites Professor Mike Cooley, a technological philosopher, in the delusion of the West's assertion of ""the One Best Reality"" as our tower of Babel, and Waters suggests that Ireland may represent an alternative vision of meaning. He warns of diversion by emigration, attention, by the same media that Zoo TV celebrates and mocks and subverts. ""The original form of colonisation simply told their victims that they were worthless, and would have to live with it. The modern form of colonisation tells us that we are only worthless if we remain where we are; it bombards us with images which devalue our own place, diminish our psychic gravity, and lure us away. We are all angels now, rootless, restless, horizonless, homeless."" (277)Waters wrote this a decade and a half before a more diverse Ireland emerged and U2 released ""No Line on the Horizon."" It'd be interesting to have him and the band reflect on what they've learned since then that supports or weakens Waters' arguments here. They may be difficult ones to parse and this book may lack its own center, but it does stretch towards intellectual horizons in innovative, if uneven and erratic ways. These may be Irish, for the spiral rather than the linear, the ""both-and"" rather than the binary ""either-or,"" has been suggested often as a characteristic of the unpredictable, utopian, and philosophical Irish mind, here seen in its divergent directions on paper, as it tries to track a band's own sound."
B000HH13XO,Ulysses,,A33AOQR5ZO46Y6,Squire Taylor,19/52,1.0,951955200,Most Overrated Drivel of the Twentieth Century,"The greatest novel of the twentieth century? Hardly. A babbling, senseless tome upheld by &quot;literary luminaries&quot; who fear being cast into the tasteless bourgeois darkness for dissent? Yes, that's the gist. Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him -- but that's what literary critics do: They find profundity -- not to mention the occasional phallic symbol -- in the midst of absolutely nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that _Ulysses_ might gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use as toothpicks. As for L. Renner, who claims that Joyce's dull (if bedlam) world parallels our own - that &quot;we are all Leopold Bloom&quot;: I deny that I am so uncouth that I would exhibit such behavior on a public beach - in the midst of a fireworks display, to beat all! (Perhaps some literary critics unwind by doing such things on public beaches . . . To tell the melancholy truth, it wouldn't surprise me.) And if I wake up one dark morning to a world gone Joyce . . . Why, you may then hand me my cup of hemlock!That said, I do not recommend James Joyce's _Ulysses_. Being, however, a charitable chap (and a chap who'd rather not be tarred, feathered and ridden on a rail by an agitated gaggle of bas bleus and &quot;lettered&quot; gentlemen), I've given Joyce a single, shining star. Charity, though, ends here. What Dryden has said of Richard Flecknoe will serve for Joyce:&quot;This Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, young Was call'd to empire, and had govern'd long: In prose and verse, was own'd, without dispute Through all the realms of Non-sense, absolute.&quot;"

However, none of the above reviewers remarked that quite often, the book is rather sloppy both in analysis and detail, including a very different subtitle on the paper cover and in the book itself (I have the Jonathan Cape version). For example, in the encounter between Pizarro and the Inca throne pretendent Atahuallpa, the latter is several times presented as the ruling Inca, which he was not. Atahuallpa had just won major victories over his opponent and was heading for the capital Cusco to claim the throne when he found Pizarro and company on his way. Not very surprisingly, Atahuallpa had other things on his mind than evaluating the possible threat these foreigners could present. Another example: several times it is mentioned that the Incas had no writing. However, they had quipus, an elaborate system of threads and knots with which they could make extensive precise records. These quipus could easily be transferred through the realm with the aid of long distance runners. They could well be considered the equivalent of cuneiform, and were very well adapted to Andean state building efforts. Also the importance of potatoes is played down, as well as many other things, especially New World dating of plant domestication, that do not conform to Diamond's analysis. I was also struck by the fact that Diamond hardly ever makes reference to the work of other scientists and historians, although his work heavily leans on their scholarship. Their work is only referred to in the section Further Reading, which I find rather offensive to these scholars (also because the Index does not refer to that section). So, although this is a most interesting and challenging book, it is impossible to know what part of the argument should actually be attributed to Diamond, and what to other scientists. For example, considerable portions of the argument about infectious diseases come straight from William McNeill's Plagues and Peoples, without ever mentioning this in the main text. As a result, the book's arguments and details should not be quoted unless there is certainty that Diamond has not taken them from someone else without mentioning him or her. I think the book is very strong on biology and languages, but considerably less so on human history. Fred Spier"

Of course the book would be no fun if these two fell in love at first sight again and so through the process of cloning we have one couple living out two completely different lifetime relationships...... or does it just seem like one couple---that's what is fun to decide. If twins have such a strong mental tie to their sibling, imagine what it would be for a Clone and his gene donor.

The entries from Sunny's diaries is what gives this book a heartbeat; it is especially touching.The author does a wonderful job telling the love story. He has made the characters down to earth enough to make the loftiness of their love believable and bearable for the reader. As you get caught up in the love the hippies share, you'll feel for the struggle the Clones--- particularly the male Clone--- goes thru.

Offering a detailed, day-by-day account of the complex first month of WWI would be challenge enough for most military historians. Barbara Tuchman not only surmounts this challenge - she simultaneously weaves a compelling, suspenseful narrative with novel-like elements.The principle protagonists of the Entente and the Central Powers - the commanders and political leaders - are intimately portrayed, with their individual strengths and flaws shown to have worldwide ramifications. The theme of a dying old world with its romantic - if deluded - notions of combat, harshly confronting an uber-industrialized new world is transcendent throughout.Tuchman wisely avoids outright assertions, instead demonstrating the true tragedy of this war is that it happened and that it dragged on. She documents numerous occasions in which war could've been avoided outright, or ended with decisive action. Individual flaws, the fog of war, and nationalism were all to blame for keeping the massacre going. I rarely call history books page-turners, but this book surely is one."

B00009RB0C,The Wandering Hill: Volume 2 of The Berrybender Narratives,,A3LKWMM12AF0PU,"Miami Bob ""Resurgent Reading""",0/0,4.0,1345248000,Four Star Cowboy Book,"Some people have indelible styles which either attract or disgust the reader. I think McMurtry is one such author.His topics are the stuff that he apparently knows - America's hardest Americans. The frontiersmen, who came upon our plains which only Indians before walked, are the topic. The untamed lands were covered with buffalo herds, beavers and more. But, as stated in this novel, the numbers dwindled with the trappers' successes, and the frontier was agonizingly and far-too-quickly becoming a memory.This apparently is part of a series, but anyone can pick this up without having read the prior novel. The Berrybender clan of this book delivers British pompousness against the mountain backdrop. Their haughtiness contrasts well against the simple but survival mentality of white men called Sin Killer and more by the Indians.Although this is fictional work, it may seem more nonfictional as historical figures are woven into the plot's fabric: e.g. Lewis and Clark's Charbonneau and American hero Kit Carson. I am not sure their characters are accurately portrayed, but I assume the author would attempt to match their qualities as he could best do.McMurtry is more than a cowboy-book author. He wrote great novels and the film adaptations of his best works,Hud(from the novelHorseman, Pass By), the Peter Bogdanovich-directedThe Last Picture Show; James L. Brooks'sTerms of Endearment: A Novel, and his Pulitzer-prize winningLonesome Dove. With the exception of last named work, all of the novels concern 20th century Texas or south. This book and its accompanying works focus upon the grandparents' or great grandparents' generation of these novels' famous characters.I have noticed some criticism of this book by some readers. And, if one seeks to compare this novel to Terms or Last Picture or Lonesome - you would be disappointed. But, that contrast does not deliver failure. This is a lesser book when compared to a great book.If one were to criticize this author - readTelegraph Days. That is inferior. But, it - like this novel - is a well-above-average cowboy book. And, when I pick up novels like this, I expect something less. I know that cowboy literature is not Shakespeare - not even the equivalent to some of McMurtry's better known novels. And, for that reason I enjoyed this novel and will read the other Berrybender novels."

0451504682,The Canterbury Tales,,A3MQXFVZ9DCE8M,R. D. Allison (dallison@biochem.med.ufl.edu),143/160,5.0,930009600,One of the major influences of modern literature.,"The version of this classic I read was a translation into modern English by Nevill Coghill. As you can see above, I awarded Chaucer (and the translation) five stars; but I do have a criticism. This translation (and many other publications of Chaucer) do not contain the two prose tales (&quot;The Tale of Melibee&quot; and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;). These are rarely read and I understand the publisher's and the translator's desire to keep the book to a managable size. Still, that should be the readers decision and no one else's. I had to go to the University library and get a complete copy in order to read those sections. As I mentioned, this copy is a translation into modern English. However, I do recommend that readers take a look at the Middle English version, at least of the Prologue. Many years ago, when I was in high school, my teacher had the entire class memorize the first part of the Prologue in the original Middle English. Almost forty years later, I still know it. I am always stunned at how beautiful, fluid, and melodic the poetry is, even if you don't understand the words. Twenty-nine pilgrims meet in the Tabard Inn in Southwark on their way to Canterbury. The host suggests that the pilgrims tell four stories each in order to shorten the trip (the work is incomplete in that only twenty-four stories are told). The tales are linked by narrative exchanges and each tale is presented in the manner and style of the character providing the story. This book was a major influence on literature. In fact, the development of the &quot;short story&quot; format owes much to these tales. All of the elements needed in a successful short story are present: flow of diction and freedom from artifice, faultless technical details and lightness of touch, and a graphic style which propels the story. In poetry, Chaucer introduced into English what will become known as rime royal (seven-line stanza riming ababbcc), the eight-line stanza (riming ababbcbc), and the heroic couplet. His poetry is noted for being melodious and fluid and has influenced a great many later poets. He has a remarkable talent for imagery and description. With respect to humor, which often receives the most negative responses from a certain group of readers (as witnessed by some of the comments below), there are at least three types: good humor which produces a laugh and is unexpected and unpredictable (for example, the description of the Prioress in the Prologue), satire (for example, the Wife of Bath's confession in the Prologue to her tale), and course humor, which is always meant to keep with the salty character of the teller of the tale or with the gross character of the tale itself. I am really stunned at the comments of the reviewer from London (of June 21, 1999). He/she clearly has no idea of the influence of the work nor on the reasons why Chaucer chose to present the humor the way he has. T. Keene of May 17 gave the work only three stars, presumably because it was once banned in Lake City, Florida. (Does that mean it would get fewer stars if it hadn't been banned?) Perhaps our London reviewer will be more comfortable moving to Lake City! Another reviewer suggested that &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was only a classic because it had been around a long time. No! Chaucer's own contemporaries (for example, Gower, Lydgate, and Hoccleve) acknowledged his genius. My goodness, even science fiction books acknowledge the Tales (for example, Dan Simmons' &quot;Hyperion,&quot; which won the 1990 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year, is based on the Tales). These brief entries are too short to review all of the tales. Let me just descibe the first two. Other readers might consider reviewing the other tales in later responses. In &quot;The Knight's Tale,&quot; the Theban cousins Palamon and Arcite, while prisoners of the King of Athens (Theseus), fall in love with Emelyn, sister of Hippolyta and sister-in-law to Theseus. Their rivalry for Emelyn destroys their friendship. They compete for her in a tournament with different Greek gods supporting the two combatants. Arcite, supported by Mars, wins but soon dies from a fall from his horse (due to the intervention of Venus and Saturn). Both Palamon and Emelyn mourn Arcite, after which they are united. It is the basis of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; by Fletcher and Shakespeare. &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot; is a ribald tale about a husband, the carpenter John, who is deceived by the scholar Nicholas and the carpenter's wife Alison that a second flood is due. In this tale, a prospective lover is deceived into kissing a lady in an unusual location. And, recalling the response from our reviewer from London, apparently this Tale should not be read by people from London (or Lake City)!"

For over six decades, Arthur Hertzberg has been ""telling it like it is"" about people and events in the world of contemporary Jewish life in North America, in Israel, and throughout the world.Without the distinct Brooklyn nasal tone accent that made Cosell famous, but in a distinct voice all his own, Hertzberg has been saying and writing the absolute truth in his long and distinguished career as a rabbi, as a university professor and scholar, and as a CEO leader of various national and international Jewish communal organizations.His book, A Jew in America: My Life and a People's Struggle for Identity, an autobiography on the famous people that he has met (usually on a first name basis) and the events that he has experienced (often as a first hand participant) is a good read because history has often proved his predictions right.Soon after the 1967 Six Day War, Hertzberg was one of the first voices (perhaps the first American Jewish voice) that warned of the danger Israel would face if it did not return immediately most of the territories it obtained to its Arab neighbors. Hertzberg prophesized that it would rip the moral, democratic, and Jewish soul of the country if Israel attempted to keep the West Bank and Gaza and subsequently put itself in the position of occupying a growing and hostile Palestinian Arab refugee population.Hertzberg was one of the first to fulminate against the theology that has developed among many Orthodox Jews since 1967 that the outcome of the Six Day War sets the stage for the onslaught of the world's messianic redemption. For a small country that is struggling to live among, not against, the nations of the world, Hertzberg saw from its inception how this nationalistic and fundamentalist interpretation of contemporary events could (still) easily alienate Israel among the nations of the world and lead the contemporary state on a future suicidal path.In the early 1970's, Hertzberg was part of a contingent of American Jewish leaders who met in Israel with the then Prime Minister, Golda Meir. Golda, from a recent visit with President Nixon in the United States, wanted to talk with members of this contingent about race relations in America. She wanted to express her concern about militant African American leaders publicly articulating separatist, nationalistic, and anti-Semitic attitudes after the assassination of Martin Luther King and the decline of the Civil Rights Movement.Hertzberg responded in this public discussion to her concern by expressing his own about Israel. He warned the Prime Minister that a `Black Panther' problem of their own was developing in Israel, that a growing number of non-Ashkenazi Jewish citizens, recent immigrants from North African and Asian countries, were feeling estranged from mainstream Israeli life.Hertzberg predicted that the present Labor led government coalition would pay a heavy price in future elections if it did not start to listen and formally address some of the complaints and concerns of these Edot Ha Mizrachi Jews who perceived their citizenship status as second class.Golda and her Labor party did not seem to heed the advice. In 1977, Menachem Begin and his Likud Party, with the overwhelming support of this ethnic constituency, dethroned the Labor establishment for the first time in Israel's history and formed its own coalition to lead the Knesset, Israel's parliament.Being able to read the present and make educated predictions about the future is a gift that Hertzberg possess. It is a gift, though, that does not always translate into effective leadership. It is questionable, when reading the book, whether Hertzberg, as a pulpit rabbi or as the head of a Jewish communal organization, looks beyond the realm of symbolism in the various leadership roles he has assumed throughout his career.Hertzberg demonstrates an uncanny ability to look at the big picture, to see the forest through trees. He is able to articulate goals and a direction that the institution or organization that he leads ought to travel. He never seems to follow through on the dreams and direction that he envisions and proposes.Perhaps he does not feel it worthy in his latest book to write about the day-to-day work he did with other professional staff members and volunteer lay leaders trying to put his dreams into practice. Or, during his long leadership career, he perhaps felt it was beneath his dignity to engage in the mundane work after he articulates the grand vision.Many rabbis of Hertzberg's generation have been known to take a patriarchal attitude towards their career and calling, where they look at themselves as separate from and not simultaneously as a part of the people that they lead. Hertzberg, in this regard, does not hesitate to assert without conflict his independence.Since this patriarchal attitude usually does not succeed in the often corporate and collaborative world of contemporary Jewish life today, it is not surprising that Hertzberg has chosen in his later years to abandon the pulpit and the Jewish communal world for a university professor position where he can focus his individual energies exclusively on teaching, research, and writing.I worked for fifteen years as a Jewish Educator in a synagogue. I had a hard time getting excited reading about the study and outside activities that Hertzberg engaged in throughout his distinguished career. It took effort for me to stop asking the question of who was tending to the store of his synagogue or Jewish communal agency while he was involved in so many endeavors that went beyond the realm of his leadership position.I am glad I did make the effort. From reading A Jew In America, I gained a more profound understanding of where we as Jews have come from in America and a strong sense (as Hertzberg would confidently argue) where we as Jews ought to travel.Elliot Fein teaches Jewish Studies at the Tarbut V'Torah High School in Irvine."

B00086P97K,"The crimson fairy book,",,A20IIR0422G3A5,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""",1/1,5.0,1251504000,Another Great Reader for Parents and Grandparents,"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was `The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the `translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his `fairy tales' were even `copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few `warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which `pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as `stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another `danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been `old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children."

It was certainly a large mistake, considering I could not stand the book in the long run. Although the general concept of the plot including synesthesia is a good idea, overall the execution was not well done. From the very beginning I had no interest in the characters and felt as if they had no depth. And even though the main character, Mia, is supposed to be in eighth grade I thought for a while she was in fifth. I couldn't relate to her or any of her friends for that matter and felt as if Wendy Mass's interpretation of a eighth grade girl was correct, nor realistic. I could not stand this book, although I feel as if I was perhaps two or three years younger it might actually have appealed to me. I would never recommend this for someone my age."

B000MTRTTE,The Count of Monte Cristo,,,,1/1,5.0,1008547200,Superb! Dumas&#65533; brilliance shines on&#65533;,"Dumas' classic paints an engrossing tale of love, treachery, and revenge. This superb book begins quickly, drawing you in to the world of Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a world sacrificed for another's ambition. While he spent years in a forgotten cell, his lust for vengeance grew. When he finally escaped, he carefully and patiently exacted his perfect revenge.This book has many good qualities, some almost too good. Dumas created a fascinating, enthralling plot, complete in every detail. However, there were times when the plot became too detailed, and forced me to slow down and think about what went on. Also, the pace of the book is perfect: as the action unfolds, the book reads quickly, but then slows down again to give importance to the time Dant&egrave;s takes in his quest. For all this, Dumas' masterpiece ranks as one of my all-time favorite books, one I would recommend to anyone."

0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A19FKIDY5355W5,"""mikkerpikker""",0/0,5.0,993945600,Pleasurable and enlightening,"Catch-22 is the definitive modern satire and deals with all of our society's 'pet themes' like racism, human idiosyncrasy, the horror of war, bureaucratic obtuseness and imprisoned lives. The distinguishing feature of this novel however is how much FUN it is to read: a pleasure from the first chapter to the last. Heller's caustic, poignant humor had me chuckling at least once per page throughout, something no other book has ever done for me. The acumen he displays in exposing our often circular reasoning was particularly memorable and is immortalized in the phrase Catch-22.The book is far from a technical masterpiece - it is certainly not written in iambic pentameter - but the simple, lucid style and accessible register facilitates the progression of the story perfectly. As Albert Einstein said &quot;Things should be as simple as possible - but not any simpler&quot; and Heller honours this axiom very well. The only &quot;difficult&quot; element of style is the non-chronological plot structure, which can be confusing at times. Yet, even this serves a purpose, that is, to create an atmosphere of confusion that adds to the overall effect the novel has on the reader.The delightful entertainment value of Catch-22 is an essential element of, and adds greatly to, its central virtue: the satiric exposure of human inadequacies. However much fun the novel is to read it remains a social commentary that - below the surface - is as frightening as any Stephen King novel. Heller strips reality bare, eliminating the hue of our opinions, the bells-and-whistles and comforting rationalizations; forcing the reader to look at the world - and himself - impartially. Pablo Picasso once said that &quot;Art is a lie that makes us see the truth&quot;, and Heller's artistic masterpiece shows us that reality is more frightening than fiction and after reading this novel I'm sure you'd agree."
B00005W8DW,Liar's poker : rising through the wreckage on Wall Street,,A1J0YNR1SSFCVS,"john purcell ""johneric99""",134/141,5.0,1058227200,"One hand, one million dollars, no tears.","In the 1980's, Michael Lewis was a neophyte bond salesman for Salomon Brothers in New York and London for four years. Liar's Poker is a high-stakes game the traders, salesmen, and executives play each afternoon, but it is also a metaphor for the Salomon culture of extreme risk-taking with immediate payoffs and clear winners and losers.This is the story of how Lewis survived the training program, inept but mean-spirited management, an aborted take-over even featuring a white knight, layoffs and the 1987 market crash before quitting to find his real calling as a business journalist. While Lewis's career did not take off quickly, he eventually became a highly paid producer, although not in the league of the true top dogs.Lewis tells the real story of Wall Street in both go-go and crash days with self-deprecating humor enlivened with his ecletic wit. Colorful and well-known Wall Street characters appear such as Michael Milken, Lazlo Birini, Warren Buffett, Bill Simon, Sr. and John Guetfruend. All business students need to read this as even those with advanced degrees in finance such as myself, will learn how things really work. The story of how the junk bond and collateralized mortgage backed security markets emerge is told to fill in a chapter in financial history. Perhaps most interesting is some of the political machinations, rampant at Salomon, which lead for example for Salomon to ignore the junk bond market, allowing others to flourish and eventually attempt to take-over Salomon using junk bonds.Lewis also describes for all investors the conflicts of interest and lack of governance on Wall Street long before Eliot Spitzer and Arthur Levitt became the champions of the little guy. My next step is to read Lewis's later books."

When a bad book is written it is difficult to be convincing to anyone about its badness. It boils down to an opinions spitting war. Hopefully that will not happen here.If you are interested in the lives and eccentricities of polygamists, their bizarre behavior and their propensity to violence in defending their beliefs then this book will offer some enlightenment.I read the book specifically to find out more about Dan Lafferty and the murder of his sister-in-law and niece. I wanted to read the interviews that Krakauer had had with Lafferty and to get a better understanding as to how such heinous crimes could be perpetrated against members of the Lafferty family--Dan's own extended family-- in the name of religion. The book was informative from that standpoint.But if you think that this book will give you the supposed inside story of the dark side of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) you are sadly mistaken.In the first place, none of the fundamentalists interviewed by Krakauer are members of the LDS Church. Since the late 1800's all individuals practicing polygamy and, more importantly, given to views and teachings that are inflammatory and contrary to those accepted by the LDS Church are summarily excommunicated. Moreover, Dan Lafferty--even in the Krakauer interviews--admits that he is not a member of the LDS Church and that his beliefs depart dramatically from anything the LDS Church teaches.In the second place, Krakauer's supposed research is riddled with references to the works of individuals like Fawn Brodie--an avowed nonobjective enemy of the LDS faith who wasted her life away writing unbelievable drivel about the Church's origins for decades. Mind you, she didn't stop with insubtantiable rubbish about Mormonism. She also wrote a landmark series of books about America's Founding Fathers that painted them as nothing more than a lecherous bunch of womanizers who just got lucky when it came to democracy. Brodie's reverse chauvinism is as transparent as water and the chip on her shoulder all too evident.If you are interested in historic facts regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read Leonard Arrington's excellent biography of Brigham Young, American Moses. It provides a fair narrative of many of the events included in Krakauer's book--information terribly twisted and misrepresented, I might add.If you want to read this book in order to look at radical religious fundamentalism, especially the tragic events centering on Dan Lafferty and his brother, Ron, then do so. But take Krakauer's supposed &quot;facts&quot; about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints as what they are--nothing more than mean-spirited, small-minded hearsay."

B000NXKKS6,The Silence of the Lambs,,A2YTPJK48EWGKW,Joseph P Daly,0/0,4.0,984960000,A great literary work,"Thomas Harris is a masterful suspense genre writer. This is common knowledge. What often get overlooked are the wonderful literary aspects of his work. Silence Of The Lambs works as both a suspense novel and a fine piece of literature.Gender issues are a major theme in this wonderful novel. Buffalo Bill does not kill his victims for money or sexual pleasure or fame. He kills his victims, all of who are female, for the most superficial aspect of their beings, their skin. Buffalo Bill wants to become a woman and he believes wearing women's skin will make him one. I do not need to tell anyone to ask a woman to find out if it is skin that makes a woman what she is. Women are being objectified by Buffalo Bill.Also supporting the theme of gender issues is the compelling character of Clarice Starling. Clarice is an up and coming, star student in the FBI Academy, who wants to become part of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. This unit is extremely difficult to get into. Jack Crawford, FBI Section Chief, wants to give Starling a job, however it involves a lot of paper work. ""It was tempting to get into Behavioral Science in any capacity she could, but she knew what happens to a woman if she's ever pegged as a secretary - it sticks until the end of time."" Starling is trying to avoid falling into the common stereotype of women in the workplace.There are many instances of gender issues in this novel, and if you still do not believe me, read the novel and figure out which room the well is under that Buffalo Bill keeps his victims in. These are not coincidences. The literary aspects are there. There are no `throw-away lines' in this novel. To say so would insult Thomas Harris. Every sentence in this novel is there for a reason, whether it be to advance the suspense or to advance the literary themes.Thomas Harris writes an incredible novel that can be enjoyed on a purely suspense genre level or on a literary level. It is a gripping story and one that propelled one of recent American literature's most famous characters, Dr. Hannibal Lecter into pop-culture icon status."

Born to a mentally ill mother who dies when Trudi is three, Trudi is at first bewildered by her small size, hanging from doorframes to ""stretch"" her arms and legs, praying that she will become more like other children, and believing that if she is truly good, God will help her.Though a circus dwarf once comforts her by describing a fantasyland filled with gold and jewels, where everyone is a zwerg, Trudi finds that real life is not so magical. She is physically and emotionally assaulted, and, as a teenager, watches in horror as the Nazis come to power and assault and later ""deport"" her Jewish friends, who are now considered ""different."" Trudi's experience of her own ""otherness"" makes her a sympathetic friend and active supporter of the local Jews, and Hegi evokes great power by connecting the overwhelming Nazi horrors with the life of one small person in one small community. Through Trudi, Burgdorf's citizens come alive--those who befriend her and those who reject her, those who support her efforts to help the Jews and those who don't, and those who pity her and those who are inspired by her.Throughout the novel, Hegi shows the power of storytelling to influence lives. Trudi works in her father's pay-library, and she is the community's best known storyteller, creating entertaining and lively stories that teach lessons, especially during the war years. But Trudi is no Pollyanna--she also uses her storytelling as a weapon against those who offend her, wreaking her own brand of personal vengeance. As the novel evolves, her childhood companions come and go. Some remain stalwart friends, and some change with the times. She matures emotionally, falls in love, and becomes part of the community's rebuilding after the war.Hegi, who lived in Germany until she was eighteen, includes the small details of German life that bring the community and Trudi to life. Her depiction of war-time horrors is honest, and the stories of Trudi's Jewish friends are heart-breaking in their realism. Despite the sadness inherent in the times, however, Hegi is often lyrical in her celebrations of happiness, and Trudi's stories are often enchanting. Incorporating universal themes of love and hatred, life and death, strength and weakness, and acceptance and rejection, Hegi creates a novel that is as powerful on its second reading as it is on its first. n Mary Whipple"

I knew just from those short passages this author was a true romantic at heart. Sort of every girl's dream of her white knight coming to take her away to paradise.Well, after reading this rather large autobiography, (Over 200 chapters) I found out something about myself. I do not often cry but did several times while reading about another person's misfortune in this book. The author Jack Vink has a gift at telling a story so clearly it is like knowing the man himself. Many nights it was only him and I, together trying to get through one trying ordeal after another.He sought true love but found out a beautiful package on the outside does not guarantee a beautiful person inside. He was betrayed by a lady he fell in love with at first sight but was just too blind to see it. This lady is the person that put him on the road to despair and ruin and yet in his heart he never stopped loving her. The story will take the reader many places they have never visited or will never see but thanks to the storytelling ability of Jack Vink they see it through his eyes as if standing next to him.This was indeed a wonderful read and I could not turn the pages fast enough. When I came to the conclusion I gasped out loud and said a silent prayer for this author. ""G-d Bless you Jack Vink wherever you are, and may your quest of true love be found.""Jack, you are the diamond hidden away.......to be found by the angel that mentally desires and craves the gentleman that you are with knowledge of the four basic truths.

Rather than following conventional writing techniques, Erdrich offers a short story cycle narrative in which two characters, Nanapush and Pauline, tell a story from two very different perspectives. I will have to admit though, the story is confusing due to this feature, but it also adds a personal touch that sets it apart from other novels. As unique as the novel may be, the tale is clouded with imagery that often leaves readers confused as well as frustrated at certain points. Moreover, the descriptions of Native American life and the events that unfold in the novel seem almost mythical and very unrealistic. This seems to suggest that Erdrich has a certain reverence towards Native American culture and views it with awe and vivid imagination."
B0006FD9TI,"Tom Cringle's log, (Famous novels of the sea)",,A3B4QRKQ3Y75SR,W. Wedenoja,5/5,4.0,1162080000,"Three stars for entertainment, five for history","This book is based on a collection of very popular stories that were published in a magazine in England beginning in 1829. The author died in 1835, and the stories were consolidated into this volume in 1869. The stories describe the fictional career of Tom Cringle as a young British navy officer who is sent to the West Indies, specifically Jamaica, in the early 19th century. The author himself went out from Scotland to Jamaica in 1806, working first on several slave plantations and later as a merchant in Kingston, before retiring to Scotland in 1822. Many young ""gentlemen"" went out to the West Indies from England and Scotland in search of a fortune during this period - the height of the sugar plantation era - therefore this account is of considerable historical interest. The author had an intimate, first-hand knowledge of life there and then to draw from - unlike C.S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian, who have written similar accounts - therefore we should look to him rather than them to learn what that life was really like. I found the book to be delightful and fascinating and was sorry to reach the end as I had learned so much from it. It is one of the best depictions available of the period. The author goes into great descriptive and probably accurate detail about anything and everything, including the dress of the times; manners and customs; entertainment; diet; dining; and relationships among whites, Creoles, mulattos, and Africans. We also learn about architecture, transportation, fruits and vegetables, disease, piracy, and hurricanes. Most of the book takes place on land, particularly in Jamaica, but there are significant sections on Cuba, Haiti, Cartagena, and Panama as well. I was particularly interested in his depiction of the slave fest of Jonkonnu and the arduous and dangerous expedition across the isthmus of Panama. I think this ""novel"" also allows us to see this period from the eyes of people then and there. They seemed to have a devil may care, live for the day approach to life in a time when life was generally short and in a place where death was always close at hand. In contrast, we today are more or less guaranteed a long and healthy life, with few obstacles, and take a much more cautious approach to living. This is a great book if you are truly interested in colonial life in the British (and to some extent Spanish) West Indies in the early 19th century. It is also far more entertaining than In Miserable Slavery, the famous and invaluable diary of a British overseer. On the other hand, you will probably not be entertained if you are just looking for an escapist naval adventure."

It is wonderful to have on the shelf. However, it isn't all that easy to take on the road. The CD-ROM, edition, however, is plenty portable when fully installed on a laptop computer.One other reviewer panned this software as ""buggy."" I have seen no evidence of that. I have it running on Windows XP Professional and all signs point to stability. A great tool.-------UPDATE: A few users have noted that Microsoft, in its quest to plug all of the gaping security holes in WinXP, implemented a security update August 8, 2006 that prevents this program and several others from launching. If you contact Microsoft and ask for HotFix KB924867, Microsoft will e-mail the HotFix to you. The HotFix addresses the issue. You do not have to uninstall the entire security update, as other reviewers mistakenly suggest.After more than a year, the software continues to function well. This is a great dictionary if you want and need comprehensive content.

I particularly liked it because, at least in part, it's a celebration of the bicycle, an almost forgotten device that is coming into its own as an efficient, simple vehicle -- and a hell of a lot of fun.

The final chapter offers practical advice to ""Bluewater Cruisers."" Its too old to discuss the current Somali pirates, but it does have some interesting cases of Somali piracy from 1999. This would be well before Somali pirates were regularly making the news and collecting multi-million dollar ransoms. It does give a very good flavor of what modern piracy and pirates are like.The ""practical advice"" reads like a list of things the author was told during interviews with captains and crews of ships. While the advice is sometimes helpful, it is not a detailed discussion based on empirical evidence.Another shortcoming with the book is a lack of an index. This is not as dramatic of an omission as it could have been since the book is generally well organized."

After I posted my 1-star review, the review began getting numerous comments within 20 minutes. The comments all said variations of ""no evidence you read the book."" My review's negative rating began shooting up, and within 45 minutes my review disappeared. Now, is it reasonable to think there are hordes of outraged citizens reading my review and instantly trying to get it deleted by posting identical criticisms? Or is something else going on? I strongly suspect the author (whose juvenile blog posts suggest he has the time and inclination) of creating some ""sock puppets"" and trashing his negative reviews.But my experience turned out to be a perfect example of the mentality of this book. It is not interested in truth, or scholarship, or genuine debate. No, it's just about shouting down the opposition and settling scores. The author has written how upset he gets at conservatives being labelled ""fascists"" and has proclaimed this is his attempt at saying, ""I know you are, but what am I?""So he throws in a few footnotes at the start of each chapter to make it look like he's been doing lots of academic research. If you check the footnotes, they usually turn out to be some totally obscure person who has no relevance or influence to anything nowadays. Careful readers will notice that the footnotes drop away as each chapter flows into what are essentially op-ed ""essays""; only then, when people are lulled into believing this is a well-supported thesis, is the supposed link between fascism and liberalism made (always on ridiculously flimsy grounds).The whole thing is laughable. Reading the author parse some totally ignored speech by Hillary Clinton for its fascistic undertones shows how weak this guy is for material. Of course, there's tons and tons of material to show how fascism and conservatism are very, very closely linked. But all that is verboten to mention here. To read this book, you'd think Hitler's main platform was free health care.Scholarly this ain't, that's for sure. This guy isn't a journalist or academic; he's just some dime-a-dozen op-ed writer. HNN had an online forum with real professors pointing out how muddled this book is, and the author ""participated"" by basically just brushing it all aside without addressing the criticisms. You see, academia requires proof, evidence, the ability to defend your thesis in open debate. This author knows he can't, so he will just ignore negative comments (or try to delete them). He simply retreats into his own closed-off community where no one will challenge him or point out his lack of qualifications, and where he doesn't have to actually put any real work into his thoughts.Sadly, this is another example of the conservative mindset of inventing a narrative to fit their predetermined partisan views. If anyone disagrees with them, you're likely to get something akin to the ""no evidence you read the book"" shutdown, as if no one could possibly legitimately disagree. I certainly hope no intelligent conservative would bother with a book like this. It's very insidious actually, and even desperate, the way it sacrifices truth for partisan advantage, and concocts a phony version of history dressed up with the trappings of academia to make it look believable. One day, the people who reinforce their partisan dreamworld by reading this kind of garbage will slam up against the real world, and it won't be pretty. But they'll have only themselves to blame."

I have read over 1000 books on every type of psychic abilities you can imagine.One day I stumbled into a book store and the cashier brought a book back to the shelf that someone had ordered and not returned. &quot;Tarot Made Easy&quot; was the title. I picked it up and from that moment on I became a professional tarot reader with 98% accuracy. I could tell my friends if they were constipated or not. No joke, this book can tell you if you will receive a package in the mail. The weird thing is that there is some kind of powers that lies in this book. Not only am I a good tarot reader so are everyone that wants to be but does not know how to.You are probably wondering where I am going with all this and here it goes:Since that day I picked up &quot;Tarot Made Easy&quot; By: Nancy Garen my life changed. Now several years later Nancy Garen has written another book. This time the book is about making up your own meanings to the tarot by simply pulling a card and living the card you pull from the 78 card deck. Sound kind of like the weje board? Well, It's as powerful if not more so. &quot;Tarot According To You&quot; By: Nancy Garen is the first book I have ever read that makes you the main character. You actually live the book. Now there has been many books and movies about this very thing and now there is such of a thing.I ask of you to please grab a copy of both books I mentioned and challenge yourself or a friend to the best true life adventure you could ever imagine.

I must warn you that you will never be the same after completing &quot;Tarot According To You&quot;Closing Statement: Could you imagine waking up every day and knowing what situations are facing you and your world?

If they continue to hate big business and the rich who worked to become wealthy and employ thousands of people, they will regret it in the end.If the government continues as it is, what happens in Atlas Shrugged could happen in the US and the people will be the ones who suffer in the long run, because of their lack of interest and looking for a free handout or drug fix.Read this book, you will learn something.

B000FC2QGE,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,,A1RLYOPK16YXC1,Stacey M Jones,7/7,4.0,1173916800,An accessible and entertaining study of knowledge and cognition from a gifted writer,"BLINK: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING was a very interesting, quick read, that made me think of other books I've read recently on cognition, knowledge and decisionmaking, such as The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki (another New Yorker writer), The Logic of Failure by Dietrich Dorner and The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker (whom Gladwell references in this work). This book is about how we know what we know, how we decide when to act on that knowledge, and how our other emotional needs and underlying associations enter into our process to disrupt it. Gladwell writes about his premise linearly, developing his ideas and enriching the concepts as he goes along with rich examples from sports, pop culture, healthcare and psychological research. It was a fascinating and educational read.The subject of BLINK is that the human mind is capable of quick, decisive, correct thinking -- we can know things in the blink of an eye. Gladwell's introduction focuses on the Getty Museum's purchase of a kouros that turned out to be a fake. All the Getty's tests confirmed that the kouros, though very rare, was authentic, but when outside art experts saw it for the first time, they knew instantly that it wasn't at all authentic. How did they know? Some of them couldn't articulate this...they just knew that it was wrong.Gladwell states that this ability is founded on ""thin slicing"" -- the ability to separate necessary information for decisionmaking from ""noise."" Gladwell then explores the ""locked door"" -- the premise that a great deal of our ""thinking without thinking"" goes on in our subconscious, and try as we might, we cannot understand how we know what we know. In this chapter, Gladwell explores psychological testing of human subjects with ""priming"" -- planting certain words in subjects minds and then watching how they behave in social situations (like planting polite words and observing heightened polite behavior or, conversely, aggressive words and aggressive behavior).In further discussion of subconscious influences on conscious decisionmaking, Gladwell uses the Warren G. Harding case as an example of cultural preferences for certain traits -- preferences that are rooted in the subconscious, of which we aren't even aware. In this discussion, Gladwell uses the Implicit Association Test research at Harvard (a fascinating experience...you can take your own at: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/) that measures the degree to which one holds preferences for thin or young people, or relates images of weapons to black men or science and math careers to men. This is cogent to the discussion of quick decisionmaking because these views may be predictive of how we may act in certain kinds of spontaneous situations.The subject of spontaneity leads to a fascinating chapter on a large war game, the Millenium Challenge, and the two approaches taken by its combatting leaders. The Blue Team used copious amounts of data, slicing and dicing. The Red Team, didn't believe that the fog of war could be lifted and went into battle giving a great deal of control and autonomy to lower-level soldiers and commanders. The Red Team won (until Blue changed the rules and started again!). Gladwell uses this example as a way to illustrate the damage too much information can do. A discussion of expertise follows in which Gladwell points out that experts snap judgments are different from the rest of the population's quick impressions because they are more informed. And this is, to me, the nut of the whole book. Blink thinking works best for those who have a basis of knowledge on a topic (such as the art experts' views of the fake kouros) because whether their decisions come from behind the locked door or not, they are informed by years of knowledge acquistion. They are often better able, as well, to understand some of the key aspects of their responses. The penultimate chapter is about the Amadou Diallo case in the Bronx, in which four police officers fired 41 rounds at an unarmed black man standing on his stoop after midnight. Gladwell's dissection of the case is fascinating and enlightening, as he takes the position that the police were neither racist nor blameless. Due to two aspects of the situation that makes people ""mind blind"" -- increased situational ""arousal"" and lack of time or ""white space"" to assess the situation, the officers acted out of their basest instincts because the situation (of their own making) reduced their ability to ""read the mind"" of Diallo. The final chapter includes an example of how our first impressions can be misshaped by other information that isn't exactly relevant, women earning positions in symphony orchestras by playing anonymously behind screens.Gladwell's work is so readable and fascinating and is a great reference for work, home and group decisionmaking because it explains our intuitive knowledge, when it functions best and when it misfires. I STRONGLY recommend this book!"

Arnold ""karnold78""",5/5,1.0,1063324800,Interest Ends at the Title,"With a catchy title containing the words &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;prada,&quot; as well as a comparison (not glowing, however) to &quot;The Nanny Diaries,&quot; this book caught the attention of many readers. Thus, a top ranking on the best-seller list for many, many months. However, lacking any type of textual flow, over-use of flowery and unnecessary adjectives, and extreme drama over issues that the typical person would consider ridiculous, this book should be considered a waste of time. The tantalizing New York fashion gossip aside, it lacks any depth and most readers will likely find it difficult to empathize with, sympathize with, or even hate the central character of the story. Simply put, Lauren, it's no &quot;War and Peace.&quot; She could have ended the book saying &quot;HA, I helped you waste money, since this book is like reading high school gossip!&quot; Because, for the first time in a lifetime of reading, I put a book down without finishing it. Readers are better served elsewhere."

This is one of the darkest books in the the series, but is fascinating in it's exploration of Elvis' past, Joe Pike's hidden insecurities (who knew?!), and how one man's overwhelming desire to have his way can lead to frightening consequences. I have to admit I saw where the story was going pretty early on - but despite that, I couldn't put the book down. I read it straight through and I think I'll probably read it again soon to pick up the finer details I zoomed past in my desire to see what happened next.

We walk with a troubled protagonist and a toe dipping into history.I am left very troubled. I was thrilled by this thriller; I am also traumatized. It is undoubtedly and superbly well written. Bannon is not afraid to pursue the most despicable crimes in his story. What works well here is that he avoids graphic description in favor of hint and that sense of dread coming from the increased tension. In all honesty I was enthralled by this book but won't say I enjoyed it; this is because of the underlying nature of the crimes against children with which Bannon was forced to deal. The prose is eloquent, often gritty and flows beautifully. It perfectly fits the time and the place. But even more than that, the odd one-liner throws in a comment or a mere statement of fact that raises a big question - I simply had to read on for the answer.The book also serves an educational purpose with its historic settings, insights into Interpol and frank discussion of hidden crimes against children. We should learn and not allow these things to happen anymore. But boy oh boy, do we miss the boat, time and time again."

It was the third book in the Enid Blyton adventure series, The Valley of Adventure. It is a children's fictional mystery story.This was a story of four children and their hilarious parrot Kiki. Lucy Ann is the the youngest and most sensible; Dinah, and Philip, always in their never ending battles and Jack, the oldest. All of them accidentally fly in the wrong airplane, piloted by two mean, nasty men. The children and men land in a valley in the middle of nowhere. The children are left alone! They notice that the men had brought three more planes to illegally transport treasure which they have stolen. Philip sneaks into a plane to get help while Jack takes care of the girls. Will the children all stay safe? Will the nasty men capture them all? Will Philip bring back help? Read the book to find out.I liked this book because it is not around the time people sat in front of computers all day but also not in the time when horses were the quickest transport. I did not need to know about olden times to understand and enjoy the book. I love learning about what Enid Blyton has in store for everyone. I also like the fact that the books are British so the vocabulary is unusual. I highly recommend this book for nine year olds to adults."

0310238587,"Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, The",,A3IGK1JER1AJNH,Crazy Horse,2/5,1.0,1228435200,The Prophet of Money and Intolerance: Armstrong,"More than anyone else on the margins of Protestant religiosity, it was Herbert W. Armstrong who fashioned the ""electronic church."" Starting out in advertising in Oregon, he switched in 1933 to pitching religion on the radio. He amassed a fortune, built a massive headquarters, and founded Ambassador College in Pasadena, California, where he moved his business ventures in 1947.Armstrong blended end-time speculation and the idea that the Brits were Israelites with the slogans of pre-World War II fundamentalist religiosity. Some may remember hearing his booming voice on The World Tomorrow radio show or seeing him eventually perform on television, or recall reading his Plain Truth mass-circulation magazine.Armstrong could have been the model for the comic Dave Barry's amusing quip: ""Jesus saves, send the money."" He eventually augmented his Radio Church of God with congregations, launching the Worldwide Church of God (WCG). He led the WCG as its pastor general until his death in 1986.His ""church"" was not without controversy; his troubles surfaced when he ousted his even more gifted son, Garner Ted Armstrong, who turned out to be a high-living, spectacular moral failure. When Herbert W. Armstrong passed away in 1986, his financial empire was in decline. Joseph Tkach, who replaced Armstrong, lacked his theatrical skills. In 1995, Joseph Tkach Jr. replaced his father and was soon forced by massive financial setbacks to cut much of the headquarters staff, sell real estate holdings, and then in 1997 close Ambassador College.Feazell provides the official, but highly sanitized, account of the fall of the Armstrong empire. He grants that under Joseph Tkach Jr. the leadership of the WCG was driven to abandon various unorthodox doctrines, including much of the end-time speculation and the British-Israel connection (p. 12). This was necessary to salvage what remained after the collapse of the Armstrong empire. Feazell seems to indicate that those who remained at the WCG headquarters believed the bizarre teachings of Armstrong.But Feazell also admits that ""despite the poor research skills of certain [unnamed] cult-watchers, Herbert Armstrong did not deny the divinity of Jesus Christ"" (p. 216 n. 14). The Armstrong movement, whatever its strange ideology on crucial issues, was also well within the parameters of fundamentalist Christianity.Much like a failed business venture, it tried to hold some of the badly splintered followers of Armstrong together while also finding a way of salvaging something in the aftermath of a dramatic market failure. While downsizing the Armstrong empire, its managers claim to have discovered orthodox religion. With this strategic shift, the WCG was eventually admitted to the National Association of Evangelicals.Why should any of this be of interest to readers in general? When on 14 November 2004 Richard Mouw and Rabi Zacharias spoke in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, Joseph Tkach Jr. was on the stand supporting the effort of Greg Johnson (Standing Together Ministries) to evangelize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Earlier Johnson had introduced Michael Feazell, special assistant to Joseph Tkach Jr., to his Latter-day Saint friends and evangelical associates. Included in this group were the ardent anti-Mormons at Living Hope Ministries who specialize in attack videos.Those folks then produced a video entitled Called to Be Free, which purports to tell the story of how and why the WCG found the real Jesus and gained evangelical respectability. This video appears to be an attempt by countercultists to suggest to the Saints, based on the model of the WCG, how they can gain full recognition as an evangelical denomination."

He tells his sister Phoebe, ""...I have to catch everybody as they start to go over the hill...I'd just be the catcher in the rye.""

In that second portion of the text, he criticized the left for its arrogance, its being out of touch with that which it claimed to want to remedy.Orwell raises issues that could as easily apply today pertinent to those dedicated to &quot;change&quot; the conditions of those of whom they have little grasp.

Buck was sold to a man and Buck was taught a lesson with a bat to his head. Buck saw many dogs he knew that had been sold to people who needed sleigh dogs. Finally Buck was sold as a sleigh dog. He fit in with all the others. Buck could not be lead dog. He wanted to, but there was another dog to take that position.This is a very slow paced book, yet it held my interest. I like how the book put Buck in a bunch of different settings.

I couldn't stop turning the pages until I reached the end. I am SOOOO glad that I read this book before I read a couple of the reviews on this website! Yes, Cindi mentions Dr. Phil in her story. Not too surprising when you read on the front cover that he wrote the foreward for the book AND he is an essential part of the story. I found it interesting that we get a glimpse of Dr. Phil we don't see on television, that of a concerned, caring, and loyal brother-in-law. He never stopped trying to find the person responsible for this crime. We should all be so lucky to have a brother-in-law who cares so much. I also don't understand how someone who read this book could say that Cindi spends the entire book talking about ""how great she is"". On the contrary, Cindi spends a great deal of time talking about how wonderful her family, friends, and co-workers were to her during this difficult time. Do you REALLY think all these people would rush to the side of a self-centered braggart? I find that difficult to believe.Bottom Line: If you are a hopelessly cynical, bitter, negative person, you may find reading this book a total waste of time. To everyone else: This is a beautiful book. It speaks to all of us about the power of making positive choices. Thank you, Cindi, for sharing your story. You are an inspiration to all of us."

0786418052,Saigon to San Diego: Memoir of a Boy Who Escaped from Communist Vietnam,35.0,A25O63D2U6RXLA,"""mhado""",6/6,5.0,1084838400,Poignant and Soulful,"Trinh Do's ""Saigon to San Diego"" is the Vietnamese version of the ""Diary of Anne Frank"". The war is seen through the eyes of an innocent 11 years old. He takes us on a personal journey as we witness the last day of Vietnam and the days of ""re-indoctrination"" that followed. But more importantly, he delivers us a message of hope in the human spirit. The book is poignant because it gives us a glimpse of life under communism. This book is soulful because it is inspiring - by reminding us that people can take away our possession and our freedom, but they cannot take away our spirit if we don't let them.I've read LeLy Hayslip's ""When Heaven and Earth Changed Places"" and Kien Nguyen's ""Unwanted"" and thought they were well written, though a bit disturbing because of their depictions of Vietnamese as prostitutes and beggars. Trinh Do's writing is fresh and surprisingly uplifting because he showed that Vietnamese can be noble with an indomitable spirit instead of being portrayed as victims. His writing style is candid and disarmingly open. Don't read this book if you don't want to cry or laugh. It is full of emotions and will carry you away. Definitely on my list of ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" books."

""Lasher"" was fast-paced and afterwards left me highly anticipating ""Taltos."" However, with this novel being the conclusion to the previous two, I was disappointed. Rice's focus of the novel is not on the Mayfair Family. By the last 50 pages or so...I kept thinking...""how is she going to end this?"" I was left with that terrible feeling that nothing was going to be explained properly and this story was not going to end as I had anticipated. As another reviewer has mentioned below, the ending is very rushed - this is very true. If you have enjoyed ""The Witching Hour"" and ""Lasher"" you will of course want to read this book...but be prepared to be disappointed."

I took the recommendation of other reviewers and I read it a second time and I enjoyed it even more.The thing about the book is, it has to be read twice because there is so much going on that it's easy to miss most of it the first time around. The nature of the book is that different characters try to tell the same story and so they place emphasis on what is important to them. So sometimes &quot;clues&quot; to plot events are overlooked by one character while very important to others.I laughed out loud at some incidents and I found myself deeply saddened by others.

I've read many books on the banking system, politics, the control big business has over the government, the cause & effect of wars, but this book incorporates them all, and makes it crystal clear of who's really pulling the strings, and why there is so much unnecessary strife, conflict, hostility, pain & suffering throughout the world today.The author most certainly has the qualifications to write this book, as he was an economic hit man for over 20 years, until his conscience got the best of him. He names many of the mega corporations and their CEOs that are pulling the strings that are causing all the wars, all for the sake of a higher profit margin.I thoroughly checked out many of his footnotes for accuracy online, and was able to establish the authenticity of all of the facts throughout the book.I just stumbled across this book in a bookstore, and was very surprised it is not receiving worldwide attention! It should be mandatory reading before a person is even allowed to vote. It should be taught in schools, and it shoud be a criteria for all international reporters to read this book.John Perkins not only clarifies the causes of all the wars, poverty, and the reason there's so much hatred of the American empire throughout the world, he offers many very logical solutions.By far one of the best books I have ever read, and I am an avid reader."

While it is far from accurate history, it is a beautiful legend of the origins of that curious non-Slavic race called the Magyars.

This book, although designed for clinicians, should be read by every person who must confront pain either in themselves or a friend or relative.

0967599504,Return Engagement Plays for Seniors,,,,0/0,5.0,974851200,The Art That Conceals the Art,"Jules Abrams has done it all. In &quot;Return Engagement,&quot; he has captured the essence of the aging process and the durability of the human spirit in facing up to the physical and mental challenges imposed Mother Nature. Morever, Mr. Abrams has done it in a way that bespeaks an appreciation for the way that seniors relate to each other--especially when the seniors are widows--an ever-growing group of women who share a life style that is little understood or appreciated by the larger community. Of all the forms of writing, I have always considered play writing to be the most difficult. Were I to try play writing, I am sure that would be true. So, I have read Mr. Abrams plays with great admiration for the sense of ease with which he creates his dialogue, builds his story line and brings each tale to a satisfying conclusion. As a professional writer, I know that good writing is never as easy as it seems. It is, after all, an art that conceals the art. In writing for senior theater, Mr. Abrams has chosen a difficult task. But he has done it well. And we are the richer for his efforts and his talent."

The book had several copy-editing problems, for which I don't blame Nora Roberts aka J. D. Robb but the publisher. I think if the same book was written by another author, maybe I could have been satisfied with it. But with Nora/J.D., I always expect the best because I know she can do it.The sexual tension between hero and heroine wasn't as blazing as the previous ones. Her previous books all contained some sort of dark moments between hero and heroine; however, CEREMONY didn't really have any dark moment between them.As for the mystery part, it's not hard to guess who did it and why the person did it in the beginning. In other word, it was very predictable! Nora/J.D. tries to confuse the readers with some false clues, etc.; however, who cares when the readers already knowthat those clues are false? (esp. for me, thanks to my avid Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie reading)I think CEREMONY was average. But because I enjoyed the previous books in the series, I'll look forward to reading VENGEANCE IN DEATH, the next one in the series"

They face many childhood events including a ""haunted house"" and school play.

He has done a lot of research on the killings - so far 20 victims have been found - five in each of four different cities, with the fifth killing being more sadistic. Genny Madoc is Cherokee Pointe's town oddity. She inherited the ""sight"" from her grandmother, enabling her to see the crimes while they are in progress, and occasionally see into the killer or victim's minds. While Dallas does not believe in this hocus pocus, he cannot deny that Genny's visions have elicited results and additional clues. Working with her cousin, Jacob, the town sheriff, Dallas discovers that there is indeed a link to the fifth victims, and that Genny may be on the killer's hit list.The murders are sadistic and chilling, and nothing is left to the imagination. There are many potential suspects on the list - it is up to Dallas to identify the culprit and save the woman he loves. I thought that the police relied too much on Genny's visions to solve the crime - made them a little inept. And since I am not a fan of paranormal stories, it was hard to suspend belief at times. But Barton is a first rate storyteller."

Carr attempts to guide the reader's reactions with overstated adjectives to describe the shenanigans of Billy and his minions, and I found Carr's style to be simplistic, biased and insulting. In short, Carr's hack job on Billy is extreme and undermines an otherwise well-done sypnosis on Whitey and his vast legion of enablers."

Bible has been the most controversial book in the history so it is much more worth reading than all the commentaries written on it.

The story is set in a small, old town, Maycomb County, where a black man called Tom Robinson is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch, who works at the state legislature, defends for Tom.The story is written from the point of view of Scout Finch, who is Atticus's youngest daughter. Because of her innocence and curiosity, Scout often finds it hard to understand why adults act in certain ways. She makes simple, but true and honest remarks about the world around her - about how life can sometimes be so unfair. Scout's thoughts often make me reflect on my own opinions of life.This book is definitely a page-turner! I am very touched by Scout's relationship with her family. To me, Atticus is the best father a daughter could ever ask for. He is intelligent and patient. By defending for Tom Robinson in court, Atticus teaches his children to follow their hearts and ""do the right things"" even when others condemn them for doing so.By the time I finished the book, I felt like I was one of the characters in the story. I almost thought that I was standing beside Scout and watching her learn more and more about life.

Instead of writing in a more realistic manner he chooses to glorify gang life. he compromises the information because before long he is caaught up in trying to fit into this particular group. The authors objective when writing this type of an anthropological look at this group is to try to live among this group and observe their way of life. I think most people are aware that poverty has a way of making people lose all hope for any future outside the barrio. This is not to say that it&quot;s impossible but looking at it realistically one has to know that it extremely difficult, and that few are able to make it out to a &quot;normal life&quot;. I expected more from this book. I think the author had a chance to observe in a objective manner, without allowing personal feelings to get in the way. Somehow the author was unable to this."

I became a Holy Spirit healer with Dr. Fuller in Florida who is famous for dental healing where mercury/almalgam fillings actually turn to gold in your mouth before your eyes. I have also been a meditation teacher for over 20 years. I have studied complex systems, seen many miracle healings and witnessed miracles of healing in my own work. I am not easily impressed. At first Dr. Sha system just seemed a little to simple to be real. But the more I thought about it the more sense it made. Dr. Sha has synthesized all the elements that I knew worked in healing - prayer, sound therapy, physical postures, positive thinking, gratitude, etc. But the real ""proof of the pudding"" is in the eating. When I tried some of the mantras and exercises it was amazing. These deceptively simple procedures possess tremendous power. The first exercise to build energy in the Dan Tian really lit a fire in me. Later when I did a chi gung stance using the golden ball, the heat started in my body and a burning smell filled my nostrils. I found out later that this was a sign that the heavy metals were being burned up in the body. That night I went to sleep with the Book which he had energized at his workshop. I followed the instructions he gave and as I lay there with it the most powerful energy went through my body. It was very blissful but very intense.

B00005WKDR,Parable of the talents : a novel,,,,0/0,4.0,922838400,This is masterful story telling at its finest.,The book was excellent and kept me interested however as I am finding with most of her novels she seems to end them in the middle of a thought. The ending was rushed which was so alarmingingly obvious beacause the rest of the novel was so deliberately paced. The relationship between the mother and daughter was not explored at all eventhough it starts off being the glue that holds the narrative together. The ending was an I-need-to-get-my-publisher-off-my-back-so-I-need-to-hurry endings. This does not detract from the ultimately satisfying read.

Propp,0/0,5.0,1361836800,"A RE-ENVISIONING OF HUMAN HISTORY, AND THE ORIGINAL TABOOS","Evelyn Reed (1905 - 1979) was a women's rights activist and an influential member of the Socialist movement in this country; she was the Socialist Workers Party candidate for President in 1972 in several states, for example. She has written/coauthored a number of other books, such asSexism and Science,Problems of Women's Liberation; a Marxist Approach, etc.She wrote in the Introduction to this 1975 book, ""The early history of half the human species---womankind---has largely been hidden from view. To bring it to light requires a reinvestigation of anthropology, where the role and accomplishments of women in prehistoric society are buried. This book is a contribution to unveiling that remarkable record... This book affirms that the maternal clan system was the original form of social organization and explains why. It also traces the course of its development and the causes of its downfall... This book... presents a new theory about totemism and taboo... The ancient taboo existed---but it was primarily directed against the perils of cannibalism in the hunting epoch."" (Pg. xiii, xviii)She states, ""none of the familiar agruments, whether biological, instinctual, or psychological, can sustain the proposition that the primitive sex taboo was directed against incest."" (Pg. 11) Later, she asserts, ""Our rejection of cannibalism, therefore, is not innate; it is a social acquisition."" (Pg. 25) She adds, ""To drink one another's health with wine is a vast departure from the practice of eating the flesh and drinking the blood of humans... it is a tribute to the human victory over cannibalism."" (Pg. 42)She argues, ""It is far more likely... that in the beginning it was the females, not the males, who reacted to any perils involving their offspring and sustenance. So long as males remained hobbled by individualism, competition, and striving for dominance over other males, they could not respond to the need for group preservation. But the females, already equipped by nature with their highly developed maternal functions and... capable of cooperating with other females, could achieve the self-restraint and foresight required to take the measures necessary for group survival. They instituted taboo."" (Pg. 69)She suggests, ""in the matriarchal period women decided for themselves whether they would eat meat, and usually they did not."" (Pg. 93) She says, ""in the period of the maternal clan, when men were occupied with hunting and fighting, women were the principal producers of the necessities of life for all the members of the community."" (Pg. 104) She summarizes, ""Women then were not simply the procreators of new life, the biological mothers. They were the prime producers of the necessities of social life: the social mothers."" (Pg. 129) She notes, ""The matrilineal kinship system testifies to the priority of the matriarchy... the maternal clan [was] the unit of society that preceded the father-family."" (Pg. 132)She says near the book's conclusion, ""The matrifamily... emerged at the beginning of barbarism, about eight thousand years ago... What took place in the middle period of barbarism to bring about this transition from the matrifamily to the father-family... This is a largely uninvestigated question... Clarification of this subject will also shed light on the central mystery of anthropology---the transition from the matriarchal order to patriarchal, class-divided society."" (Pg. 393)This is a thought-provoking work that was of great influence to the early women's movement."
B000P97XL0,Two Planets,,A3MQXFVZ9DCE8M,R. D. Allison (dallison@biochem.med.ufl.edu),15/15,4.0,927244800,One of the classics of 19th century science fiction.,"This nineteenth-century German science fiction novel (&quot;The Two Planets&quot; or &quot;Auf zwei Planeten&quot;) by Kurd Lasswitz (1848-1910), a mathematician, philosopher, and scholar of Kant, was not translated into English until 1971 (by Hans H. Rudnick). Thus, it had very little influence in the development of English or American science fiction. Nevertheless, the novel did have a significant impact. It was a popular book of young German boys, particularly Wernher von Braun and Willy Ley. Thus, the novel had an influence in the development of our space age. It ""fired"" their imaginations and had a big effect on German astronautics. The ""two planets"" are Earth and Mars. Three German and Austrian explorers are traveling in a balloon in an attempt to reach the North Pole. They find that a group of intelligent beings, very similar to humans, have set up a base at the Pole. Their balloon is inadvertantly drawn in by the Martian's antigravity device and two of the explorers find themselves guests of the Martians. The Martians have come to Earth to educate mankind, to assist in the development of a utopian Earth, and to ask for air and solar energy in return. However, through a misunderstanding, a ""war"" arises between the Martians and England, resulting in the formation of a Martian Protectorate over Europe. Unfortunately, a number of Martians soon exhibit the corrupting influences of power, and the Martian rule becomes despotic. An underground movement develops, keeping the positive aspects of Martian (and Kantian) philosophy, to rid Earth of the Martian yoke. This is accomplished with the help of American engineers, who are able to build their own spaceships to challange the Martians. The ""good"" of both planets win and a new era begins in Earth and Martian relations. And, in all of this, Lasswitz has two love stories as subplots, one of which is between one of the explorers and a Martian. When Martian probes began to map the surface of Mars, one of the newly discovered Martian craters was named after Lasswitz. This is a classic volume in science fiction and serious students of science fiction literature should read it."

Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction. The story is interwoven with ever-present social and ethical questions. What does it mean to be human? What are the consequences of using scientific technology to play the role of Creator? How far is too far when tampering with the order of the universe?Upon my first reading of this book I was pleasantly surprised to find that the creature is very intelligent and human-like, though grotesque in appearance. It is a shame that the Frankenstein creature is universally represented in the minds of the public as an oafish and very dimwitted monster with bolts in its neck and a green pallor. The true Frankenstein is far more intriguing. I love the parts of the book that are a first person narrative by the ""creature"".I highly recommend this book as it is an enjoyable piece of classic literature. If you are a fan of horror, read this for an understanding of the early roots of the genre that you so love, and that those roots actually formed intellectual arguments and contained actual substance. This book is a must read for the well rounded reader. In fact, had I graduated from high school and never read this book, I would begin to question the quality of my own education."

The author jumps right into the story and gets his readers hooked. The strongest aspect of this book is the appeal of the story line. The other elements that contribute to the books sucess are foreshadowing, different dialects and the strong characters. This book uses language that is unique to it and while it is a little hard to follow in the early pages soon the slangs used are easily rembered. Also the well developed characters add a new dimension to the book.This book intrests, appalls, and stuns all at once. The actions of the narrator and his frinds are often so extremely violent it's sickening. The concept that is the hardest to swallow is how the characters of the book could act so horribly. The book takes a deeper look at what youth is coming to. All the extreme actions that are taken all to entertain this young man through out the book takes a good hard look at the narrators psyche. This book is not a light afternoon read, it is an intense disgusting and intriguing well written piece of literature."

But in 'The Martian Chronicles', a somewhat loose collection of short stories involving humans (from Earth) colonizing Mars, this reader was left wanting for something insightful or special. Instead I found this collection of stories to be very readable, at times interesting, but also at times rather bland. And at no time did I sense this book deserved to be considered a classic. This would be an insult to its author who has indeed written classics (eg, 'Fahrenheit 451').Bottom line: a somewhat forgettable book that seems to have garnered more readership than it deserves. A near miss."

It's the type of book a person can really sink their teeth into. The plot and meaning isn't just laid out for you, but nor does it take a rocket scientist to find.

0783804415,The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction),,,,9/36,1.0,937526400,No more outrage please. I've had enough.,"The best thing that can be said about Bill Bennet's new book is that it is a grammatically correct essay printed on good quality bond paper. It documents the alleged evils of the Clinton administration and attempts to elaborate on the absurd premise that the country has not demonstrated sufficient outrage over the Lewinsky matter. Obviously, the writer of this book is outraged, as are the countless career outraged-folks on TV like Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, Kate O'Bierne, Chris Matthews, Arianna Huffington, Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson, Ollie North, Jonathan Turley, Mona Cheren, Bayh Buchanan, Robert Bork, Stuart Taylor, Bill Kristol, George Will, Joseph DeGenova, ......etc., as well as all of their devoted listeners and followers. These outraged citizens of cable tv represent a larger group than those who expressed outrage over slavery and discrimination or about any other human atrocity in the history of mankind. The book calls for outrage, yet never explains why there should be more outrage over the Lewinsky matter than the intolerably massive amount that already exists. The outrage has been flooding the planet 24 hours-a-day through at least a half-dozen cable channels, hundreds of AM radio stations, and several thousand magazines' and newspapers' editorial columns, not to mention the evergrowing number of outraged websites. And of course there are the infinite outraged books, like this one, written by the infinite outraged Geraldo and Larry King guests. Just how much more outrage do we need? Perhaps he means that he would like to see the outrage take on a more palpable form, such as a mass protest in front of the white house, or a mass e-mail campaign to the congress, or maybe a public stoning of the Clintons. Well, if all of these outraged citizens could get off of their behinds and stop yakking for two minutes, maybe they could accomplish something revolutionary. Alas, these well-fed, lethargic carnivores are capable of doing nothing of the sort. Not surprisingly, the book conveniently neglects to ponder the lack of public outrage over Dan Burton, Henry Hyde, Bob Livingston and Helen Chenowith rolling around in bed ... god-only-knows what else and then (presumably) wiping themselves clean before walking into the Capital Building to sit in judgement of the president. But the author is very, very, very upset that the public isn't rioting in the streets over the President recieving oral sex and then lying about it. All in all, Bennet has written a fine book if you are a deluded moralist full of irrational hatred for Clinton and the liberals."

Instead, Grisham tells a story from the perspective of Luke Chandler, a 7-year-old boy who lives on a small farm in Arkansas during the early 1950's. The series of events that he chronicles occur during the late summer when the cotton crop is ready to be picked.The story starts out when Luke's father hires a group of ""hill people"" (the Spruills) and some wandering Mexicans to help pick the crop. The Spruills are a typical labor-based, poor family. One of the Spruills that Luke comes in contact with is Tally: an attractive seventeen-year-old girl who Luke admires. In addition, there is Hank, a burly and mean tempered man who is at odds with Luke and the Mexicans.Luke is a colorful character - he dreams of playing baseball and appears precocious for his age. His inquisitiveness and being at the wrong place at the wrong time make him a witness to several sobering events, including the birthing of an illegitimate daughter, seeing a brutal street fight, and even murder.Grisham makes a pretty good stab at writing literature. While some may find that the book is dull, and at times it is (the tension throughout was fairly minimal), Luke is a likeable character and his adventures are worth reading about. While the book is filled with stereotypes, I found myself enjoying the narrative style and the writing. However, I found that Luke was a little too curious about sex at his age - perhaps at age 10 or 11 I would've bought it, but at 7? If you are looking for a courtroom thriller, I'd pass on this book. If, on the other hand, you enjoy solid writing you'll find this book worth the time."

This is a winner!This book does not tell much about investing, more about how to save money for investing. If you don't know about investing, then complement this with The Schwab's Guide to Financial Independence."
B000BOZPKA,The Gardener's Year,,,,37/38,5.0,1016236800,Amazon's Review is Totally Off Base.,"There is humor and self-deprecation in The Gardener's Year...This is a book that will appeal to the gardener, the philospher, and the Zen deotee, the reader of self-help books, as well as the humorist. Here are quotes: ""After his death, the gardener does not become a butterfly but ... a garden worm tasting all the dark, nitrogenous and spicey delights of the soil."" ""I find a real gardener is not a man who cultivates flowers; he is a man who cultivates the soil"". ""The life of a gardener is active and full of will."" There are easy references to German philosophers, campanula alpina, Tolstoy, the perfume of manure. All this is presented with humor but there are no fools in this book. It could easily be subtitled ""Zen and the Pleasant Art of Gardening."" It didn't change my life, but it made it better. For Godsake, by this book!"

This book was published in 1852. The word usage and the 'black' talk would have made the story difficult to fully grasp . So I downloaded the audio from Librivox and then read the words while listening to the audio. The book and the audio were perfectly synchronized. This made the book very enjoyable and a real treasure. This was an important book used to awaken the folks in the North and the South to the slavery issues. Quite dramatic at times, but it fit in to the scope of the book. A great way to understand our history is to visit it as close to the source as possible using books written at the time. If you can find it, I suggest you read &#34;The Land They Fought For&#34; by Clifford Dowdey. This is the story of the South from 1832 to 1865, another great book."

Anne Bishop truly has a gift, and it's displayed here at its best.Her talent is for creating unique, fascinatingly dark worlds, and complex, interesting characters. As a longtime fan of fantasy, I can tell you it gets very tiring to see the same midieval, knights-and-castles settings, time and time again. Anne Bishop steers clear of that, crafting a unique, detailed world that will draw you in at once and refuse to let you go. Her books are wonderfully dark and sensual, although that certainly makes them not for the young or light-hearted--there is sex, violence, and other dark themes in abundance.The brilliance of her characters is best demonstrated in Daemon Sadi. Between his sadism, refusal to harm children, and devotion towards Jaenelle, he's a wonderfully interesting character--and so complex it's sometimes difficult to tell whose side he's truly on. By the time the book is over, you genuinely care about her characters, and you want to see them emerge triumphant.A warning, however. As already said, her books are both dark and sensual, and they have characters with names such as Saeten and Lucivar--something some readers might have objections to, although there don't seem to be any parallels between the characters and the origin of their names. I wouldn't recommend these for anyone under the of 13, or easily offended Christians.I would, however, recommend them to anyone else. If you like fantasy, dark fantasy, horror, or romance, give them a try. You'll find yourself swept away to a world beyond your wildest dreams, caught up in an enthrallingly horrific story of love, with romance, action, comedy, and everything else you could possibly want in a book."

Volume 2 contains seven stories by a constellation of literary luminaries: Elmore Leonard, Eric Van Lustbader, Michael Malone, Ed McBaine, Joyce Carol Oates, Anne Perry, and Shel Silverstein.&quot;Sparks&quot; details the smoldering particulars of an insurance investigator's inquiry into the burning of a beautiful woman's house. Three stars.&quot;Slow Burn&quot; is a police procedural weighted down by the protagonist's Freudian baggage. It gives a disturbing look at child molestation, sexual exploitation, mental illness, and revenge. Two stars.&quot;Invitation to the Ball&quot; presents a mystery in three parts. The protagonist, obsessed with a painting of a beautiful lady, seeks to determine whether she murdered her husband almost a century ago. He meets and woos a descendant of the lady. For all his interest in the ancestor, he shows remarkably little interest in the mystery presented by the descendant. The third mystery is a modern murder that ties in neatly with the other two. Five stars.&quot;Barking at Butterflies&quot; tells the story of a man with a rival for his wife's affection. He fantasizes about taking murderous action towards the rival. Then . . . . Four stars.&quot;Heroes&quot; began as a war story but resolved itself into quite a nice little mystery; not so much a who-done-it as a what-did-he-do.

By 'it' I mean the voice and tone with which to discuss Jesus. Many of the critics of this book blame it for not being sufficiently 'academic.' Well, I applaud Cahill for choosing to write a book that can speak to the comman man or woman.I have never felt that the Hinges of History series were meant to be scholarly works arguing controversial positions. They are meant to be engaging and entertaining books that speak to all of western civilization. I feel that they are meant to BEGIN to wake us up to the depth of history that has shaped who we are, and to put in context the ideas, such as Christianity, that have such a profound impact on us today. After all, nearly 2000 years after the start of Christianity, how many Christians can say they really understand the origins of their faith or the world in which Jesus preached?Desire of the Everlasting Hills does an excellent job of painting a picture of Jesus and his worlds and the origins of the early church. To those critics who say that Cahill doesn't say enough about the early church: You are either blind or very unimaginative. Do you want a history of organized religion? There wasn't one. Cahill's presentation of theology is the history of early Christianity, which was decentralized and personal. Once THE Church comes onto the scene then the impact of Jesus as a person fades. In the end, Cahill's book is about Jesus and his individual impact on the world, not the impact of the institutions founded in his name.Cahill's relaxed use of footnotes and citation are a blessing to the common reader. Faith is a very personal idea, and to clutter it with the trappings of an uptight and suspicious academia is to kill it outright. Go back to your ivory towers. Cahill's goal is not to explain the word of God, but to give the reader a sense of the times, a feeling of the mood in this outpost of the Roman world at the time of Jesus. This goal he achieves with unmitigated success.I have seen reviews that say not to read this book if you are a Christian, and not to read it if you aren't a Christian. These people I feel, sadly, missed the point. Most are offended with Cahill's treatment of Jesus or his presentation of theology. Whether you believe Jesus was the Son of God or not, Cahill has to explain him and what he and the people around him believed in order to press upon the reader that Jesus was a man unlike the world saw before or since. It was ultimately this uniqueness that changed the way the world viewed morality, religion, and mankinds place on Earth. Central to this uniqueness was Jesus' faith. I never felt that Cahill's discussion of theology was an attempt to convert the reader, merely to explain Jesus' attempts at conversion.How do you emphasize a man's uniqueness while trying to place his life into a historical context? I do not know, but Cahill does it well. Those who cannot see that either cannot let themselves go enough to accept Jesus' uniqueness or the fact that he really did walk among us in a very brutal and gritty time. To anyone with the slightest bit of imagination and open mindedness, this book will speak volumes and open your eyes to a better understanding of yesterday and today.Cahill deals with a mighty task in a light and amusing fashion that rivets the reader and enthralls him. His detractors either can not let go of their biases long enough to hear Cahill speak, or are not able to come to grips with Cahill's non-academic goal: to spread understanding, rather than theory. Read Cahill's book for what it is and let it move you."

There are helpful diagrams and charts that illustrate the points the author is making.This book is for women who want to better understand their fertility, avoid or achieve conception, eliminate use of the pill or other chemical forms of birth control, and attempt to conceive a baby of one sex or the other. It explains how you can use your basal body temperature (taken before rising first thing in the morning) and your cervical mucous to tell whether you are fertile or not. This allows you to avoid intercourse if you are trying to avoid pregnancy, and to have intercourse at your most fertile times if you are trying to get pregnant.I think that even women who want to remain on birth control should read this book - it is valuable to understand how your body works and why. For women who are breastfeeding, this book has a whole chapter on using your temp and mucous to ascertain whether your fertility has returned - an excellent tool since chemical birth control while breastfeeding is best avoided. For women who are experiencing infertility, charting your temps and mucous can help you discover why you aren't conceiving, and knowing this can make it easier to seek treatment.There may be more thorough books on this topic out there, but I think this is one of the best basic ones. I recommend it highly."

You will also meet a cast of colorful characters, Tristian Farnon, Siegfried's younger brother, Helen Alderson, Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Pumphrey and her Pekinese, Tricky-Woo,and a host of other colorful characters who make this a memorable read. James Herriot has also authored several other books, each one stands on its own merit and are a treasure for your family library. The BBC also produced the series "" All Creatures Great and Small"" for television in the late 1970's. The series is a masterpiece!

077832267X,Mackenzies' Honor: Mackenzie's Pleasure\A Game Of Chance (Mira Romance),,A21MY0W0L1O1BU,bookjunkiereviews,27/36,3.0,1137888000,Worth buying for Mackenzie's Pleasure,"In December 2005, I stumbled across this book (MACKENZIE'S PLEASURE) in a Silhouette edition twofer combining books by two different authors. Mackenzie's Pleasure, my Buried Treasure find for 2005, is the story of Zane Mackenzie, the youngest son of Wolf Mackenzie and his wife Mary Elizabeth (hero and heroine of Mackenzie's Mountain); I would love to see a twofer combining Mackenzie's Mountain with Mackenzie's Pleasure. Unfortunately, I have to settle for this book, which combines an excellent book with a less successful one.Zane Mackenzie is called upon to execute a mission to rescue an ambassador's kidnapped daughter Barrie Lovejoy out of Libya. The first third of the book is about how the rescue takes place and with what consequences. In the second third, Zane and Barrie are separated by circumstances until they manage to find each other. Since there is a mystery and a bit of romantic suspense to the plot, I will not go further with the plot summary. It is probably sufficient to say that Barrie's kidnapping and rescue is somewhat more complicated than either Zane or Barrie realized.MACKENZIE'S PLEASURE is one of the few stories where I genuinely liked the hero and heroine from the outset, and where I also felt that they were right for each other. That this contributed to my liking the book is not in question. Linda Howard's writing style also helped, as did her characterizations. Zane is an alpha male but not an overbearing alpha, but a protector and leader. The other SEALS came alive as did the heroine and her Ambassador father. What didn't work so well for me was the villain and his motivation (especially as explained to Barrie at the end).Unfortunately, A GAME OF CHANCE is a very different kind of story about Chance, the adoptive son. Putting Chance and Zane together in the same ""twofer"" makes some sense, given that they are about the same age and apparently fought together regularly. The problem is not that Chance is the adoptive son, but that he is a different person from Zane. Whereas Zane makes it a point to protect the woman he loves (whether he realizes it or not), Chance uses the woman he loves (the heroine) as a bait for a dangerous trap. Arguing that he is not in love with the heroine does not change this fact. Chance's story is thus a disappointment for those who love heroes in the mold of Wolf and Zane Mackenzie, men who would do almost anything (save betray their country) to protect their families and their mates. I keep wondering if Chance would again put his wife in the line of fire in the national interest; the trouble is that I cannot convince myself that he had changed by the end.MIRA's reprints: Mackenzie's Mountain (Wolf) goes with Mackenzie's Mission (Joe) in one volume. While Mackenzie's Magic (a story in an anthology) is left out, Mackenzie's Pleasure (Zane) is combined with A Game of Chance (Chance) in another volume. Of course, we have no stories for Michael and Josh, but have to find out what happy ending was in store for them from the first and last chapter of Mackenzie's Pleasure. I wish MIRA would reprint just the strongest stories Mackenzie's Mountain and Mackenzie's Pleasure.Written by bookjunkiereviews 22 January 2006"

I admire his work in marine archeology. But he's no longer on my must buy list after this one. The one saving grace for the book is it exposes the reader to the hypothesis about the location of Troy and the evolution of the Illiad and Odyssey. Beyond that, the characterizations are the thinnest parody of the worst of the Bond Movies. The addition of Dirk Pitt's newly found children to the cast of characters is a little unbelievable, and certainly unwanted. The tempo is uneven. The dilemmas are so over drawn as to give melodrama a good name. The basic premise is the least plausible one to show up in one of his books. I read it through hoping it would improve, and it just got worse and worse. At the very best this book is better than being trapped in an airport with absolutely nothing else to read...but only just. Clive Cussler is a talented writer, but he must have rushed to finish this book."

Masterfully written, the author weaves a spellbinding tapestry of events that chronicles the life of Mary Stuart, the Queen of Scots, while in captivity.The book details her stay at the castle on the island of Lochleven in Scotland, while at the mercy of her illegitimate half brother and self-proclaimed Regent, the Earl of Moray. It recounts her daring escape from her Scottish captors, as well as her woefully misguided decision to flee to Enland, rather than to France or Spain.Instead of the succor that the beautiful, charming, and very Catholic Mary, an anointed Queen, expected to receive from her cousin, the wily and Protestant Elizabeth I of England, Mary found, instead, an uneasy captivity. From the moment of her entry to England, she was in effect a prisoner, commuted from castle to castle with a never ending succession of jailers whose task was to ensure that she did not escape. It was a captivitry that was to span nineteen years.Filled with the political intrigues and conspiracies that abounded in sixteenth century England and Scotland, the book paints a sympathetic portrait of Mary, a queen that ruled with her heart, rather than with her head. She was a woman who was at a disadvantage in negotiating with her cousin, as Elizabeth, unlike Mary, ruled with her head and not with her heart. Elizabeth was very much aware of the political realities of the time and sensitive to Mary's own claim by blood to the English throne, making Mary someone to be kept in check, rather than helped.Based upon actual historical figures and events, the author creates three dimensional characters and infuses them with all the pomp and pageantry of the time. It is a stirringly written narrative that fully engages the reader. Those who love historical fiction, as well as those who have an interest in the life of Mary Stuart, the beleaguered Queen of Scots, will most certainly enjoy this book, as will anyone who simply loves a well written and compelling story."
B000IY4THI,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,,A339386JR1K8XT,Timothy Liu,0/0,5.0,1168473600,Bedtime story and classic American fiction all in one,"Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a short and entertaining book which takes the reader on a journey, following the schoolteacher Ichabod Crane and his wild fantasies. The beautiful yet dark setting of Sleepy Hollow creates a curious atmosphere, blending Ichabod's chase after Katrina with his own attempted escape from the headless horseman. The perspective of the story, told through the point of view of a storyteller, gives an interesting view, leaving out parts that the reader must fill in on his or her own. As the reader completes the story, he or she is left with a great mystery which surrounds the ending of the novel, concerning whether the headless horseman was just a hoax created by Brom Bones to scare off Ichabod Crane, or the Galloping Hessian really does haunt the town of Sleepy Hollow. Each reader is allowed to discover his or her own perspective of the story's ending.Although only a short tale, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow goes beyond the simple bedtime story. The chimerical nature of Ichabod Crane and his hodgepodge of superstitions ultimately lead to his downfall, a detail not easily uncovered with a quick read-through. Irving's criticism of dwelling too long on dreams and fantasies is exposed through the schoolteacher's flaws and supposed death. Even if the reader does not immediately pick up these points, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is still a delightful tale to indulge in.What makes The Legend of Sleepy Hollow such a great book is the author's writing style, which appeals to readers of all ages. Irving creates contrasting moods, setting scenes of joy and gaiety next to gloomy nightmares. He places the lovely home of the Van Tassels in the superstitious town of Sleepy Hollow. These contrasts create a beautiful and intricately designed setting for the legend of the headless horseman. Scholarly readers can analyze the effects of the shifts in tone and atmosphere, while younger readers can indulge in Irving's vivid descriptions, picturing themselves feasting with the Van Tassels or riding with Ichabod on his flight from the Galloping Hessian."

0253318106,Does Deconstruction Make Any Difference: Poststructuralism and the Defense of Poetry in Modern Criticism,,AAW58LG72PG7I,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""",0/1,3.0,1337299200,Maybe It Does and Maybe It Doesn't,"Deconstruction is a means of examining texts that is so vaguely phrased and inherently garbled that one is astonished to learn that its advocates outnumber its opponents by at least a ratio of ten to one. This ratio, unsurprisingly enough, is very nearly the same ratio of liberal to conservative professors in America's colleges and universities. Clearly, then, politics and criticism intersect at critical points. In DOES DECONSTRUCTION MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE? Michael Fischer makes this salient point to emphasize that criticism of texts does not operate in some amorphous intellectual vacuum. Rather, the process of subverting, teasing, and undermining texts is one that had been lifted wholesale from leftist European thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man. For this observation, I am indebted to Fischer. However, Fischer does far more than place deconstruction in its historical/literary context, one, I might add, that he accomplishes with a deft hand. He accurately takes to task the misconception that Matthew Arnold was the touchstone against which past and present deconstructionists sought to demonize as the uncrowned king of a logocentric metaphysics of presence. Arnold, surprisingly enough, as Fischer trenchantly notes, merely thought he saw himself as the avatar of western culture under assault by atavistic Philistines and Populace. Fischer also considers the role that Northrop Frye played as a New Critic, another grounded archetypal empiricist who was yet another target for Derrida and those of his ilk who soon followed. Where Fischer goes seriously astray is his ambivalent attitude toward deconstruction. On one hand he criticizes its practitioners by noting that its titular proponent, Jacques Derrida, is more than a little self-contradictory and illogical when Fischer accuses Derrida's frequent lapses as deliberate forays into irony and ludic grammatical faux pas, none of which is convincing. Yet, Fischer also draws back from crossing some nebulous line by insisting that a strong supporter of Derrida (Hartman) ""PROPERLY (my caps) unsettles our reliance on easy answers and challenges our accommodating literary study to torpid students."" Further, he (Hartman) ""champions a kind of writing that is RIGHTFULLY (again my caps) more 'speculative,' 'enthusiastic,' and 'playful.'"" It seems that Derrida, Hartman et al are wrong only insofar as they are unduly enthusiastic about the merits of deconstruction. As far as the rhetorical question of the title is concerned, the answer is a fuzzy muddled 'maybe yes.' Fischer's conclusion: ""Deconstruction does make a difference: it reinforces established political and educational arrangements rather than damaging them or leaving them as they are."" Is it just me or is this last line a sterling example of the lack of precision of a theory that Michael Fischer cannot seem to make up his mind about?"

Although the beginning of this book got a bit long describing Evyind's life, I understood that it laid down a foundation for the rest. I enjoyed the romance much more in this book than her Sevenwaters trilogy. There was more leading to the romance and less abrupt in the coming together of the two people. Although I'd like some new material from Ms. Marillier rather than just having a heroine nurse a hero back to health all the time (like most of her other books). I enjoyed it at first but would like something new and maybe some more obvious romantic tension (kinda like in this book but more). Additionally, I liked how she wrote a little bit about the life they lead after coming together (some books just end at the part where the couple gets together and it always leaves me curious to know more). There were some cheesy parts in this book but it was a good, leaves-a-goofy-grin-on-your-face cheesy. Something I'd like to read in her sequel is about the life Evyind and Nessa have together and not just cutting straight to their children. It's a bit depressing to read about the people, who you cheered for in the previous book, die or become minor characters. I'm sure their lives can still be interesting and challenging after they come together... Thus far, my favorite book from Ms. Marillier is the first book in the Sevenwaters Trilogy (Daughter of the Forest) though it could've had more romance earlier, the characters and situation pulled me in and made it very interesting. Overall, I have really enjoyed Ms. Marillier's books and hope to read more in the future!"

When he wrote his memoir Night wanted us to know what had happened, he wrote this so as to prevent history from repeating itself but he has achieved so much more. His use of figurative language allows the reader to feel, hear, see, taste, touch, and smell every thing he does. ""Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed"" ( Page 34). These are Wiesel's words describing the beginning of the end of his innocence and childhood. ""From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me."" (Page 115). The last words in Wiesel's book are terrifyingly powerful as they give us the image of a man of skin and bones his age sixteen, although you would not know that by looking at him. As a young boy Elie and the Jews of Shiget face a rude awakening when the Nazis take over their quiet town and ship them off to a series of concentration camps including the Auschwitz death camp, and a number of work camps. Elie and his father form a close dependence on each other as they travel from camp to camp. They make friends and loose friends as the memoir progresses in a series of events that force Elie into an early manhood. Although I do not usually find holocaust literature enjoyable this memoir is one I really enjoyed reading. There is not a thing I would change about how this memoir is written.I highly recommend this book to all those who are above the age of twelve."

B0006AU8K6,Lord of the Flies,,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""",2/4,3.0,981936000,Sort of Classic,"In the early part of the 20th Century a Englishman called Barry wrote a book called The Coral Island. It involved some children who were cast away in the pacific. Full of British pluck they quickly get organized and build a working civilization on the Island. They are more than equal, the adult natives they meet and have far higher and superior values. They have many adventures and all end in triumph. The book was a hymn to Imperialism and the racist assumptions on which it was based. Pacific Islanders probably still ritually burn it as part of their independence ceremonies.William Golding's book has generally thought to be a response. Golding is apparently a deeply religious man and a number of his later books have religious themes. His theme is probably related his view of the nature of man. Unlike Barry he has a pessimistic view of the nature of man and his tendency for evil. He also starts by having a number of school children marooned on an island. The children are all male and appear to be from wealthy backgrounds. Initially there are attempts to collect food and carry on in a civilized way but things break down. A number of the boys chase pigs and set up a pig's head as a sort of religious shrine in a clearing. Towards the end of the book the group turn violent.Golding's book has been prescribed on school texts for years. Unlike most books set for children to read most of them seem to like it. The imagery is startling and the book is quite short. Golding's other works never quite had the same impact as this one.In retrospect although a readable book it is hard to think that it is really about much at all. The subject of the work is after all just children. It is not surprising that poorly socialized kids placed in a difficult social environment might be at sea. The books main message is probably a historic one putting in context the reality of what people are like and should be read in comparison to Barry's work which suggested a more political view of white people. Despite the fact that the historical impact has declined the book is remarkable easy to read and the imagery is startling. It is probably a good bridge for children to move from kids to adult literature."

Furthering my interest in ""Software by Numbers"" were the facts that it runs less than 200 pages and is from Sun Microsystems. In my opinion, most large technology works can be significantly shortened if the fluff is removed from them (who has time to read fluff?), and I view Sun as a respected firm that is involved with a lot of the technologies in my workplace. Maximizing financial return during the development of software is the main subject of this book, and the attempt of Jane and Mark Denne, her co-author, to show how to do so is a good one. Interestingly enough, the Preface of this text discusses how the authors arrived at the title ""Software by Numbers"", and although this title is better than the others that their friends and colleagues suggested, because it is a bit too similar to the common expression ""paint by number"" (which can be an idiomatic expression for ""easy"" or ""mindless""), I do not think it does the book content justice. ROI is anything but a simple subject. Multiple formulas exist for ROI to begin with, and return can be a subjective matter because it can involve a lot of assumptions. Quite a few financial tables are presented with the book material, and a cursory review of the accompanying ROI examples shows that there is a bit of explanation missing. Of course, there is a tradeoff here between conciseness and thoroughness, and explaining all of the assumptions made would probably not be appropriate for most readers. The authors start the discussion by stating that software development is a very difficult endeavor. The following portions of the introductory chapters explain well much of the language used throughout the rest of the book, such as minimum marketable feature (MMF) and return on investment (ROI). The authors then compare MMF-based ROI with classic ROI and discuss how to discover MMFs, how to determine their value, and how this all fits with incremental funding methodology (IFM). While there exists overlap between the architecture discussion and the content of ""Architecture in Practice"" (see my review for that text), the authors quickly move forward to discussing the delivery of valued features to customers and how parallel development of multiple MMFs is often well suited for meeting customer needs. Although the chapter on how to manage intangibles provides a much more simple explanation than books such as ""Making Technology Investments - ROI Road Map to Better Business Cases"", the authors get their point across in a succinct manner. Similarly, the authors discuss how IFM can thrive when used with the (Rational) Unified Process and other more agile software engineering methodologies."

I love all of Hemingway's extensive body of works, but this novel is by far my favourite. The story is about a young American man who is fighting voluntarily against Franco's Fascist forces in Spain. This man ends up leading a band of guerillas in what turns out to be a totally useless military foray. The novel itself only encompasses seventy-two hours, but in that time Robert Jordan, our American hero, loses his comrades in battle, falls in love, and is badly wounded. Hemingway's writing is masterful in this classic! This book, even more than ""A Farewell to Arms"" outlines Hemingway's thoughts on the futility of war, and the effect that war has on one single man. Even though the novel encompasses such a short time, Hemingway makes use of flashbacks to bring the reader into the series of events that led to this particular point in Jordan's life. Again, Hemingway makes use of personal experiences for this novel. He was actually involved himself in this Spanish civil war. His writing style is spare, although incredibly vivid. This is a truly wonderful book, that I feel encompasses all the best of Ernest Hemingway."

I`m that sucker who is always looking for a great romance novel or movie to captivate me and make me fall into the wonders of love overcoming all obstacles. So, yes, you could say I have seen and read my fair share of love stories, but this is the best.I first read this book when I was 12 after hearing incessesantly about how it was such a classic and a must-read (and of course I heard it was a romance, so that little fact right there solidified any scruples that I may have had at the time). I was mesmerized.Yes, of course it was rather difficult to understand the language at first and I did expect that. Instantly, though, I read it a second time and I locked in with Austen`s flow of words and the sensations that I went through while reading her novel were incredible.Elizebeth Bennet is such a fantastic and relatable character and I believe any woman can relate to her. She`s dignified and witty, but at the same time she`s shy and believable. She`s never ridiculous or over the top. Mr. Darcy....where do I begin? The changes in him and Elizabeth are just incredible and no matter how many times I read this book I can`t help but fall in love with them all over again. Mrs. Bennet is truly ridiculous, but she means well. Mr. Bennet is a man who always settles and never really has determination to go ahead. He keeps to himself, sometimes it seems like he even avoids the truth of things unless it becomes dreadfully grave. Nonetheless, a great character. Mr. Collins; What a man! He will keep you laughing at how absolutely ridiculous he is. And Elizabeth`s younger sisters are truly precious. Jane and Bingley are sweet and endearing. Miss Bingley is the perfect &#34;mean girl&#34;. Mr. Wickham is delightfully decieving and really supports the phrase, &#34;Looks are decieving.&#34; And lastly, the Gardiners are easily my favorite characters after Elizabeth and Darcy.The whole plot is wonderfully paced, and I will confess that first time reading it that it may seem slow and boring. But, when you really take the time to delve into Jane Austen`s world and understand the truths that she expresses with such precision that still resonate in todays society, you really become intranced. You really feel like you know the characters and maybe even recognize the truth in them and recognize people you know. Austen was insightful and really understood people and characters and the morals of her time. She was brillant and I really wonder what it would be like to have met her if she was alive today. Pride ad Prejudice is my favorite novel and I really hope this review has done is justice. This is the best of the best and it will forever remain my favorite novel.Thank you Jane Austen for sharing with the world your characters and your truths."

Scott Fitzgerald, I was not at all disappointed with this novel. The language was masterful and romantic, drawing me into the beautiful and oftentimes sad and frustrating tale of Anthony and Gloria. The first half of the book was enjoyable, filled with the dreams of every young person who falls in love with the boy she never thought she'd like or the girl he never thought he would get. The second half is relatable and sad, as the couple discovers aspects of the other that he or she never thought would be seen. All the while, the common elements of the 1910's and 1920's--drinking, parties, and the promise of fortune--pervade the novel.There were some confusing points where Fitzgerald writes in the style of a play, and the characters are acting as on a stage. I was a litle thrown off by these interjections in style, but that did not make the story any less enjoyable. Overall, I enjoyed the novel, and would recommend it for Fitzgerald fans."
B000H27WYS,Prince Caspian : The Return to Narnia,,A1G9TLZ8I5X0CA,"Jonathan Stephens ""Jonathan Stephens""",5/5,4.0,1198368000,Hundreds of Years Have Passed Since the Pevensies Visited Narnia...,"PRINCE CASPIAN, the 4th book in C.S. Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series and the 2nd one published, continues the adventures of the Pevensie children in Narnia. The story opens with Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy waiting at the train station to return to boarding school for the year where they are yanked by magic onto the shores of a strange forested island.Time, one must remember, does not move the same way in Narnia as it does in the real world; the Pevensies could spend 100 years in Narnia and return to reality to find that no time at all has passed. It turns out that hundreds of Narnian years have passed during the year that the children have been away and the Narnian world has been thrown into chaos -- the animals no longer speak; a new line of kings govern the land with a harsh scepter; the oceans have risen and the landscapes changed; the people have forgotten the ways of the old line of kings; and the stories of the old Narnia have been forbidden to be told. Beyond that, it seems forever since the last time the great lion, King Aslan, has been seen at all, and his existence has been dismissed by most as mere silly legend.This installment of the series pales only slightly to THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. The story of our four Narnian protagonists shows us once again that their identities in Aslan's Kingdom have nothing to do with what they do and everything to do with who(se) they are. Lucy is faced with the toughest decisions this time around, as she is asked to choose whether she will follow Aslan even if the people closest to her consider her crazy for doing so. I am struck again by the ease of C.S. Lewis' storytelling voice. While he may not deliver the most complex plots or character arcs, the tone and pacing of his language makes me wish I were a child again and could sit in front of the hearth and listen to his stories aloud.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"

I served at most of the commands discussed and knew several of the officers and men mentioned. My tour of duty at these very same sites was at a time 8 months after Kerry departed to begin spitting his anti-American, anti-US Military venom.When the Kerry-ites bash this piece as being just something put out by a pro-Bush lobby, they are being their usual myopic selves. John O'Neill, bless him, has been fighting this battle against Kerry for 33 or more years. It has nothing to do with politics. It is an attempt set the record straight, tell the true story and to keep a dishonorable person from becoming Commander-In-Chief of an armed forces that he designed to discredit for most of his life. I sincerely hope that this book succeeds in its quest."

B0007F0LD4,Lord of the flies,,,,6/6,5.0,943401600,A look at human nature,"I read this book many years ago in high school, and found it very philosophical. It isn't conforting in any sense of the word, but it gives a powerful message regarding the nature of humans. The whole conflict between Jack and Ralph is petty, but that was the point. Written during the horrors of WWII, W. Golding wanted to show the readers that the only difference between human beings and beasts is that we are governed by laws and civilization, without which we do become savages. Disturbing, extremely, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. Someone once told me the purpose of art and literature is to make an audience think through its powerful messages, not to be comfortable to place in a &quot;hospital&quot; setting. Lord of the Flies does exactly that. Through vivid descriptions and masterful symbolism, this book conveys a powerful message regarding human nature. A previous reader claimed, due to the Columbine shootings, this book should not be read in high schools, I couldn't disagree more. It is because of such atrocious acts that the message this book contains is needed more than ever."

This book covers the full range of instruments used in orchestras individually, it also addresses composing for whole sections (strings/brass woodwinds etc) and also spends some time on composing for small orchestras and full orchestras and the differences between than. At the end of each chapter there are helpful exercises, there are also further suggestions for exercises in orchestration in the appendix. I found this book to be very helpful in learning more about the details of orchestration; I keep it close and refer to it all the time. Although it is not as long as other books, it was very straight to the point, and very concise and above all, easy to understand."

There is no support to be found on the Macromedia site and there are errors in the book that need to be addressed.

In addition to the instructions for this step, you must also select the browse button and select product_update.asp- Before Step 1 of page 163 you need to copy the rsSuppliers recordset from the product_add.asp page and paste it in the DataBindings window of the product_update.asp page. The reason for this is that the description at the bottom of Step 3 on page 164 is wrong, but the instructions are correct.- Between steps 4 and 5 on page 166 you must add a step. You need to identify all fields on the product_update.asp page that have not been setup. To do this select a field, then open the DataBindings window and open the recordset rsUpdate. Select the matching field and select Bind at the bottom right. Then save, put, and view.In Chapter 8- page 173, step 4, set the Get Values From to CategoryName, not CategoryID.- page 184, step 4 yields &quot;No Data&quot;. However, when you run it live it does yield data. Therefore test it live and we will need to address this issue with Macromedia.Chapter 9page 200, step 3, part b (results) are not viewed in Live Date as book indicates, but it is through a browser.Chapter 11pg 239, step 8, does not need to be done. Therefore if you get an error in displaying andes_login.asp in step 11, then erase the code in step 8.There is also an error with the andes_newuser.asp page but I have yet to figure it out."

Quirk,0/0,4.0,1358812800,Collapse is great but is it necessary?,"I was really impressed by Jarad Diamond's ""Collapse"" until I read S. M. Newman (2012, 2013) 'Demography, Territory and Law: The Rules of Animal and Human Populations'. Newman is an evolutionary sociologist. The book examines the whole idea of collapse (including Tainter's) and comes up with a new population theory, which it tests on Rapanui. It shows that the population build up there almost certainly could not have happened and that the fall of Easter Island must have occurred with European contact.As well as Rapanui, which is not the primary focus, 'Demography Territory and Law: The Rules ...' looks at the amazing history of long term survival of Pacific Islands, including Rapanui (3000 years before the 'collapse'); New Guinea and Australia, 40,000 to 60,000.The author does not dispute the danger of collapse for 21st century societies, particularly due to oil depletion and overpopulation, however Newman does dispute the idea that every modern system is incapable of resisting growth and consumerism. According to Newman, it is the English-speaking industrial societies and their colonial offspring that are out of control. The Roman or Napoleonic system of continental Europe is able to resist population growth and to control resource consumption. It is not hooked on domestic population and economic growth. Unfortunately the English and the continental Europeans don't communicate on this and their citizens usually just assume that they have similar systems.Reading Newman's book makes you wonder how Jarad Diamond could not not have known these facts."

It was a great short novel in which Steinbeck keeps you interested from beginning to end. The dialogue was great and helped you to learn more about the characters without getting a bunch of unneeded information. This helps to keep the book short but you still get a lot of good information. George and Lennie are the two main characters. They are labor workers and travel from farm to farm looking for jobs to make money. They have an amazing friendship, which everyone at the ranch admires. Steinbeck puts a large emphasis on the importance of male friendship in the novel. They are trying to make enough money to buy there own land so they can be free of always having to worry about having a job or not. George is a small man who keeps up with Lennie. Lennie is very large and is almost considered mentally ill. He loves to pet soft things and this can get him in trouble. The novel ends up being sad but it is definitely well worth the read."

It's perfect. Douglas Adams turns the English language into either the rantings of an existential crackpot -- or pure upside-down damn-the-rules poetry, the kind you find in Kids Say the Darndest Things, or Emma Donoghue's brilliant novel, Room.The only reason this book won't stand the test of time is if our species gets rid of all the digital watches.Okay. So what can be said about a book with 685 five-star reviews?And why would anyone review it now?Reviewers who wish to be seen hovering above the mass of grocery store lit are always peering into the higher shelves in search of something that challenges the general mediocrity of our fiction, a plot that explodes the senses, or a character sufficiently outrageous that the mind reels trying to grasp the nuances and diagnose the sickness of the author.Such a book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not.Well, all right, the spacy berserkitude of The Guide challenges mediocrity. One might make a case that Adams is an embarrassment to the 21st Century dumbing-down of the imagination. And what this book also does, or did in 1979, was to raise the bar for the acceptably weird. There was a time when weird was Last Exit to Brooklyn, or Ulysses, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, or going way back, Walt Whitman's magnificent and unpublishable Leaves of Grass. These books of course are literature. Douglas Adams would be the first to admit he did not create any literature. But what he did create was altogether nuts.Let's see... somewhere in the Galaxy, people are running a 10-million-year-long experiment in which the Earth is actually a giant computer. Five minutes before the experiment concludes, Vogons blow up the planet because it's in the path of a hyperspace by-pass and must be eliminated. Within days it is revealed that a new technology has superseded the need for the hyperspace by-pass! Wow! You gotta love it!This is my personal literary grail, devoutly to be sought: No Rules. No disbelief to suspend. No irony left unsmelted, no buckle left unswashed. Characters marching mindlessly through the narrative with or without balls or cause. And most crucial to Gonzolit, a sense of the absurd so delicious that no discerning reader can fail to appreciate it.That is why God gave us Douglas Adams."

In 1977, the Western Writers of America voted this novel as the top western novel of all time. It probably started the whole genre (even if one counts the pulp fiction popular in the late 19th century). Historians have always pointed out that there never really was a ""Code of the West."" This was just something thought up by writers, journalists, and film makers. The West was made up of both good and bad men, just as today. But, in my opinion, this book challenges that concept. Wister based his characters on real people he interacted with in the West a few years earlier. There really were men like the Virginian.

Since I acquired an almost free copy of the book, I had to read it, having read Mr. Hyde. I did like some parts of the book, and Long John Silver was one character that kept it going pretty strong. His parrot was also a high point and should've played a more active role, albeit inane tidbits.

There is certainly enough excellent writing to make this play worthwhile, but beware, there are poorly fleshed-out characters, jarring speeches, and undeveloped themes.

B000MZNZLE,999: New Stories of Horror and Suspense,,,,10/10,3.0,995846400,An unexceptional horror anthology,"In his introduction to this book, editor/contributor Al Sarrantonio makes clear his high hopes that 999 will prove a worthy successor to such landmark horror anthologies as DARK FORCES and GREAT TALES OF TERROR AND THE SUPERNATURAL. The dust jacket even goes so far as to declare of 999: &#8220;Not only is this the largest anthology of original horror/suspense fiction of all time&#8230;but it is also the finest.&#8221; As it turns out, however, neither the editor&#8217;s high hopes nor the dust jacket&#8217;s hyperbole are justified. 999 is in fact a very average collection of horror tales, with stories that range from pretty awful at worst to quite good, though not exactly excellent, at best, and the bulk of material falling somewhere between those points.Frankly, there are few high points in this collection. Furthermore, the high points of 999 are not particularly striking as far as horror tales go, and are only distinguishable as the points of greatest contrast to the indifferent and unmemorable horror storytelling that comprises most of 999&#8217;s entries.Still some readers might enjoy Tim Power&#8217;s haunting & unusual ghost story &#8220;Itinerary,&#8221; my favorite story here, which manages to be witty, fantastic (in the truest sense of the word), and melancholy without straining for effect. Kim Newman&#8217;s lead-off story, set in a U.S.S.R. under siege from walking dead American tourists, is a great, well-written combination of creepy horror and understated black humor, and makes a strong start for the book. Thomas M. Disch&#8217;s &#8220;The Owl and the Pussycat&#8221; delivers a deep bite in the gentle tones of an innocent children&#8217;s story. Ramsey Campbell&#8217;s &#8220;The Entertainment&#8221; lacks the potency of much of his stunning short fiction and bears a little too much resemblance to Robert Aickman&#8217;s classic chiller &#8220;The Hospice,&#8221; but is nonetheless a thoroughly sinister piece of work suggesting the unnatural horrors that can hide behind seemingly harmless grins.But then there&#8217;s no avoiding the negatives. Bentley Little&#8217;s &#8220;The Theater&#8221; starts off as a dully written reprise of Ramsey Campbell&#8217;s infinitely more frightening &#8220;The Show Goes On,&#8221; and quickly segues into a goofy psychodrama driven by the zero-personality main character&#8217;s unhealthy obsession with vegetables. Stephen King cruises through with a by-the-numbers tale of a demonic painting that could make for a passable episode of NIGHT GALLERY&#8212;one could be forgiven for thinking the editor was satisfied enough just having King&#8217;s name to plaster on the cover, so minor is his contribution. Peter Schneider&#8217;s &#8220;Les Saucisses, Sans Doute&#8221; might be well-intended in its mockery of the pretensions and cheesy glamor rife in &#8220;extreme&#8221; splatter-shock horror, but this short piece is too slight, the kind of thing one might scribble up to pass a lazy lunch-hour. Quite disappointingly, T.E.D. Klein&#8217;s &#8220;Growing Things,&#8221; a surprise contribution from this all-too-unprolific writer, also turns out to be a little insubstantial.The best that can be said is that there are some fine, if unremarkable stories between the covers of 999. However, the &#8220;good&#8221; stories are not good enough nor in sufficient proportion to invite comparisons with truly exceptional horror anthologies, such as the two volumes mentioned at the beginning, or THE OXFORD BOOK OF ENGLISH GHOST STORIES, THE DARK DESCENT, and the SHADOWS series, to name but a few others."

I bought it for $3.00 at a used book store and am planning to give it back to them for free. I don't want the negative energy hanging around my house.

0808510258,Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (Barron's Book Notes),,A60ZBGFQGB98Z,Don,0/1,5.0,1282867200,A great classic,I read this book back in the early 1960s when it was new. The book changed my life for the better. I just reread it and it is still powerful but I was surprised at how different it was than what I remembered. My memory from high school is mostly about the trial. When I reread it this year I saw much more of the brilliant writing and the interplay of the characters. Part of the genius of this book is how good it is and how easy it is to read.
1423310799,The Portrait of a Lady (The Classic Collection),,A3JA1D0617MNFR,Adrian,16/50,2.0,1141948800,A poor puppet show,"This is not a novel at all; but a poor puppet show displayed by a clumsy puppeteer, a man who has an impressive grasp of English language but unfortunately is not in touch with reality.The novel is about Elizabeth Archer, a young, attractive and intelligent American Miss, who happens to have her own mind: nothing wrong with this portrait, so far so good. However, Henry James makes the fatal mistake of writing about things which he does not know. Right at the beginning of the story an English lord is introduced, handsome, athletic, cultivated and very rich, the arch type of ideal Victorian masculinity, the type every woman has a vague picture of in her fantasies, but unable to paint in full. He falls in love with the penniless Miss Archer and proposes to her. He is rejected. Our heroine cannot find any faults, but cannot imagine him as her husband. This is not unusual; women have their own minds, tastes and idiosyncrasies. Men have no logical explanation for the feminine taste. The English lord disappears, only to return later in the novel: this time ready to propose to another poor American girl, Miss Osmond, who, like our heroine, cannot picture herself married to this Victorian ideal. Then there is countess Gimini, Mr. Osmond's sister, another penniless American woman married to an Italian count. And last, but not least, one has to mention Mr. Osmond, who wins the heart of our heroine, but ends up disappointing her. There are several other characters, but three are worth mentionening: Miss Stackpole (here James is in his own element, depicting an independent, yet traditionally sentimental American woman), Mr. Goodwood, the ardent lover of Elizabeth Archer, who seems to have no other purpose in life than run after a woman who has decidedly rejected him and beg for her hand. Mr. Goodwood is portrayed as the athletic type with a large square jaw, a visible sign of a determined, firm character (back then the pseudo-science of physiognomy was in vogue, and a firm sqaure jaw was a shore indication of a firm character).Has anyone ever heard of a handsome rich English lord going around and proposing to penniless American girls? Has anyone heard of an Italian count marrying a poor American woman? Now Mr. Osmond and Madam Merle: Has anyone ever heard of an American father threatening his daughter with penury and imprisonment in an Italian convent? Has anyone ever heard of an American woman calling herself Madam Merle... Madam?Henry James is the final product of mediocrity supported by everything money can buy. He has no originality; he is sophomoric at his best. In his eagerness to become an English gentleman he has forgotten what it means to be an American. ""The Portrait of a Lady,"" acclaimed as a classic and a masterpiece, is nothing but an empty puppet show. Despite all my efforts, constantly repressing every impulse not to throw the book in the garbage, I could not go beyond page 484...And I am an ardent reader of Victorian novels.Two stars for the excellent prose.Read George Gissing instead!"

B00006SL44,Shadow Puppets,,,,1/3,4.0,1039392000,Fast Paced fun for lovers of &quot;Ender&quot; Series,"First off, I put Ender in quotes above because while the last few OSC books of this series began with Ender, they have really transformed into the &quot;Shadow&quot; series or more specifically, Bean.Like Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon before it, Shadow Puppets is a very entertaining book that follows the Battle School kids progression from training to their journey back to Earth and beyond. In itself the book does a decent job keeping us excited and guessing about characters and their futures. A must read for all &quot;Ender&quot; fans.Now again for the quotation marks. I know from speaking with many fans of this series that the immediate fascination ended with Ender's Game itself. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY! Perhaps I hold my allegiances too close, but I felt somewhat betrayed by Bean. While Ender was a reluctant hero, Bean is in many ways very arrogant.While I appreciate their relationship and all of Bean's accomplishments, it saddens me that so many readers have neglected to read through the original ENDER series. While it is true they have little of the strategic battles that made Ender's Game one of my favorite books of all time, they employ such compassion and psychology in a world that Ender chose for himself. Instead of returning home to the celebratory crowds (and Peter) Ender shuttles off to the world of their defeated enemies to colonize and create a new world. In this world visions of the past lead him to do something far nobler than any could imagine. Redemption and education persist and soon through his travel through time, he sacrifices all those who age in order to commit to a better world.All in all, don't miss the &quot;Shadow&quot; series for all the Earthly exploits we all wanted to hear more about, but PLEASE take the time to experience the ages of Ender's wisdom in creating a new world outside the one he left, and his absolute determination to improve the lives of not only those who hold him dear, but those who ultimately he was sent to destroy.Do yourself a favor, read carefully SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, XENOCIDE, and CHILDREN OF THE MIND! OSC poured more thought provoking material through these three than the rest (however entertaining) combined."

Eve and Roarke's relationship progressively develops but they still maintain their individuality which is quite humorous at times and never boring. What really made this story of conspiracy in the medical/political world of hotshots work for me is the supporting cast of characters - Roarke, Feeney, Peabody, McNabb, Louise, Mira, Mavis, Whitney, Tibble - they all work together to make Eve Dallas a believable and heartwarming heroine and achieve the effect of a fascinating supporting cast to the storyline. The mystery involved in this story is based on a shady character with superior surgical skills playing God with people's lives, including Eve's!I particularly found Feeney's father figure role interesting and would love to see that developed further in future storylines.Thank you, Nora, for the great stories; you never seem to run out of ideas.

All three of them dish it out and and have to take it on different occasions. I know though, that overall the kids love each other. All the kids love reading this book. I didn't read the book as saying that teasing and abuse were ok. Rather, I think the message is that kids sometimes tease when they are looking for attention or a playmate.

Have not noticed any typographical errors or problems with runes, elven speech etc. It all seems perfect to me. The map of Middle Earth is a bit small, but maybe it is best viewed on a pc instead of the kindle anyway. The map is divided into 4 parts, so you can see each quadrant separately. That helps.

B000NXH1RE,Brave New World,,A1J3PGM3D2F7IF,"Bruschi, N.L.",1/1,4.0,1299024000,Brave New World not as deep at 1984.,"Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World presents a vision of consumerism and mechanization, where social strata are bred into the biology of factory-produced twins, and stuporous stability is the highest government ideal. I found myself captivated by the book's system of society, its veneration of Henry Ford, and culture of instant gratification. If Orwell's vision was pure fascism, this is pure capitalism.On the downside, Brave New World is nowhere as intellectually deep as 1984. The plot and characters are underdeveloped and inconsequential. Huxley makes the joy of reading solely in its exploration of his (brave new) world, but that can only carry the book so far. Throw in a compelling plot, differentiated tone of story-telling, and dynamic characters and it might have been perfect.Continued at: [...]"
B0007FCO3Y,The island of Dr. Moreau (Ballantine books),,,,0/1,5.0,928627200,The Island of Dr Moreau is a masterpiece.,"Written more than a century ago The Island of Dr Moreau is still read by many people to this day. An Englishman is shipwrecked and lands on the island where Dr Moreau portrays god and struggles to create the perfect race. Messages on evolution and the misuse of intelligence is found throughout the book. Issues on the role of God and his relationship with mankind are also discussed. Everyone can relate to The Island of Dr Moreau through the the beast people. We are the beast people surpressed by God, or Dr Moreau. We bury our intincts and our desires, and try to follow what society believes is right. Once in a while those emotions can no longer be hidden and they burst through our molded personalities. It is probable that this is what HG Wells was trying to express in his work since it was written in 1896, around the same time when Charles Darwin anounced the idea of evolution. There are passages in the book that make reference to the old testament. I enjoy this controversial aguement in The Island of Dr Moreau. This might well be the mystery that unkowingly intrigues poeple to read this book. Anyone will enjoy this classic science fiction thriller."

B000NNOTXI,To Kill a Mocking Bird,,A1RYTP3A5JYNP6,"S.K. Wells ""Aslan's Princess""",1/1,5.0,1357084800,A Child's Mind,"I am sure others have said it more eloquently than I can hope to accomplish, but when I love a book this much I can not help but try to say why. Everyone loves different books for different reasons, and I loved this one because of the way it places you in a child's mind. A child who's mind is being stretched by the things going on around her, a mind that is struggling to make sense of the world. How on earth does Harper Lee capture us with a story about a lazy small town? How does she fascinate us with the everyday? I think that the voice that tells her story is the magic key. Scout doesn't have any prejudices yet; she is being molded by those around her. She argues with them and puzzles about them and finally makes up her mind about them. She carefully watches all that is happening, and though she only discerns half of it, the older reader can pick up on all the rest. Sometimes, though, Scout is the wiser. She reaches straight through to ways of seeing things we would have never found, and says things we never would have dared to say, because we understand all the implications, but she does not.I was reluctant to read this book, I must admit. I mean, the title doesn't sound all that appealing, even if you know it isn't really about killing mockingbirds. In fact, I think that made it even worse, because then I asked, ""Well then, what is it about?"" and the back of the book (I have the Warner Books edition) didn't tell me much, and all my Mom said was, ""It's about prejudices in the south."" Well, I felt I had already read enough about that, but the more books I read with that all-encompassing description, the more I find that there is more to that topic than I ever imagined. We are a very diverse people, on this planet, and we all seem to have a different way of looking at things, a different way of saying things, a different community of thought that shapes us. For another thing, this book is about more than one kind of prejudice, so even if, after that, you still feel that you have read plenty of material on black discrimination, that's still no excuse to not read this book. History books tell you the story from the point of politicians. This tells you the story from the point of the people who lived during that time in their own small town, only distantly affected by those all-important matters. It tells you what people thought back then, which is every bit as important, I believe, as the events themselves.I can understand the vague descriptions on the book covers. I'm not sure that I could do better. I also understand why everyone says you should read it, and I heartily agree with them. You really should not miss out on this one. I don't think you need a big study guide to accompany it; if the author thought it needed that, she would have written one herself. Just sit down in a comfortable spot and read it. That's what Lee intended. That's how you'll enjoy it the most. When you're done, see if your view of things hasn't changed just a little bit. Maybe you'll smile every time you see a mockingbird. Maybe you'll stop and think every time too. That's what I do. I hope you do too."
B000O1UCCQ,The Clan of the Cave Bear,,AADZRQ2390WBM,Ginger Voight,0/0,4.0,1301270400,A Strong Female Lead,"In 1977 writer Jean M. Auel began research for her first book, an evocative historical fiction novel which dramatically intersects the lives Neanderthals and Cro-magnon humans in prehistoric Europe.""Clan of the Cave Bear"", the cornerstone in the Earth Children series, tells the tale of a Cro-magnon orphan Ayla, who at five years old survives an earthquake and an attack from a cave lion before she is rescued by the kind and wise medicine woman Iza. Though Ayla's appearance is vastly different, and in the eyes of the Neanderthal clan even ugly, the young girl wins a place among the clan when the holy man and Mog-ur Creb decides her presence is in fact a good omen.Leader Brun remains conflicted between the steadfast traditions his people have long relied upon for their survival versus the benefit of this strange new creature among them. Had the spirits, their totems, really sent this unusual child to them for ""luck"", even when everything she does inevitably challenges their philosophies and customs?From the way she communicates to the way she expresses emotion, Ayla learns early on she must continue her struggle for survival by integrating with them and behaving as a Clan woman should, rather the ugly outsider she is. However having evolved past what her adopted people are able to do, this proves problematic for the earnest young girl.Whereas her Clan relies on ""memories"" and instinct, she has the ability for analytical thought and deductive reasoning. Whereas her Clan adheres to strict tradition, Ayla is able to adapt and evolve. She finds herself unable to abide constrictive cultural expectations in her ever growing desire to challenge herself and to push herself to the limits of her ability.For a group of people who rely on conformity for their sense of security and balance, she provides a constant source of conflict. This is especially true with Broud, Brun's son and leader to be. He resents her presence and does whatever he can to make her life miserable, longing to steal from her what he can never possess.Ayla, in her attempt to survive her sometimes dire circumstances, ends up an unintentional hero for feminism itself. What the Clan see in her, and alternately fear in her, is the strength that will carry over in all Homo sapiens for millenniums to come. Her strange behavior, thoughts and feelings are the very things that ensure the survival of her race while highlighting the limitations of their own.It is through this young child who ages no more than a teenager through the course of the novel that we once again are reminded of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.Author Jean Auel herself demonstrates this spirit by the thoughtful and thorough way she researched for this groundbreaking series; not only did she do extensive study on the Ice Age but physically learned many of the survivalist skills she describes in her books.It lends an authenticity to the tale that will keep the reader vested intellectually, while Ayla and her struggle to survive will emotionally engage audiences for many years to come. Though the prehistoric world they live in is vastly different from our modern times, the themes are widely universal. From racism to sexism and cultural divisiveness and superstition, the dynamic characters of ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" speak a language in which we are all familiar."

The author created a slang language in it that was a mix of cockney and russian slang. The outcome is a funny yet disturbing piece of prose that at times reads like poetry. It is vicious with a point. The author is fighting a conflict between being evil or being good because you have no choice. It reminded me of the Catholic religion and Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. Are you being good because you are afraid of the consiquences of being bad or are you being good because it feels like it is the rite thing for you to do. Living life as you see it should be lived. You don't kill or rape because a Religious law tells you it is sin; instead you don't do these things because you know that they are wrong. This is what Nietzsche called living beyond good and evil. And it has neve being better protrayed than in this book. A clock work orange.

0849942926,"Thunder of Heaven (Martyr's Song, Book 3)",,A1K2V8BSC895CD,Joshua Olds,0/0,4.0,1300233600,"Good, but not Great","More loosely connected than the other two, this story follows two American kids living in the jungle on a coffee plantation whose lives fall apart when drug lords take over. Both are presumed dead, but Tanya had really managed to survive and begin a new life in the States. Now, eight years later, she is finding herself called back to the Venezuelan jungles to find out what really happened to her family and her darling Shannon.Meanwhile, the full plot of the drug plots takeover is revealed. More than just drugs, Tanya's family's plantation is now going to be the home of a terrorist cell intent on attacking America. To stop the terrorists and unravel the mystery of her past, she'll have to work with a rogue CIA agent called Casius who has more than one secret he's not telling. It all hurtles forward to a stunning conclusion that speaks volumes on the themes of love, loss, and the power of prayer.Quite honestly, this novel is probably the weakest of the three. While it's certainly well-done, its tone and focus are slightly different than its two predecessors. This is most likely attributed to the fact that was adapted from Dekker's first (and unpublished) novel To Kill With Reason. It lacks a certain gravitas the other books carried and seems a bit disconnected from the scope of the rest of the trilogy. It doesn't fit seamlessly, but Dekker makes it work well. It's a solid book as a standalone, but comes off a bit lackluster compared to the brilliance of the first two novels. Dekker would later polish up some aspects of this story and later use the core fundamentals in novels such as Thr3e and Burn. All in all, it's another solid offering for Dekker, and served to springboard him into the success he found beginning with 2004's Circle Trilogy."
B0006ASRMM,"Huckleberry Finn,",,,,6/23,2.0,994377600,Is It the Most Overrated Book?,"Ever since Hemingway's unfortunate comments about HUCKLEBERRY FINN the book has been required reading for the literati. Like most people, I read it as but a lad. I had finished TOM SAWYER and was swept up in the stories of lost treasure and endless caverns and Injun Joe. I thought HUCKLEBERRY FINN would be more of the same, and was disappointed to find it was about a boy abused by a drunken father who runs away in a bildungsroman where he meets all sorts of unengaging characters. Even the Duke and the Dauphin come off better in the movies than on the original page.Before continuing, I suppose I ought to give my bona fides. I have nothing against &quot;classics&quot;. They've been my principle study for nearly thirty years -- Proust, Dostoevsky, Dickens, Tolstoy, &amp;c. all are great chums of mine. I'm unafraid of dead while males (oddly enough, unlike Huck, who says, &quot;After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.&quot; I get a grim satisfaction knowing Sam Clemens is now among their number, as everyone will be who criticizes what they've produced.I've recently turned 40, and just read TOM SAWYER again for the first time in a quarter century. It's still a solid book, exciting, well-written, and funny. It's a swell book, and great for imaginative children, as it was for me at Tom's age. I'm now fighting Huck again, and it's rough sailing and choppy seas. I wish I was back with Swann and Baron de Charlus! Huck's aimless drifting down the river is less interesting than seven volumes of Proust.The &quot;racist&quot; accusation is fraudulent. Twain is careless with his use of certain verboten words, but one must not judge a writer by modern standards of racial sensitivity (as with Twain) or plot development (as with Smollett) any more than future -- and I hope more rational and well-centered -- generations that come after modern writers are dead like Moses, that some of their books are not written off simply because of the twentieth century writers' rabid obsession with sex.One reason young people don't like to read is because in schools, which is unfortunately the first place many young people face anything to read, force them into areas over their heads. Tom Sawyer's story would be a better start. It's a book written by a man who hasn't forgotten what it's like to be a boy. Huck's book is written by a man exploiting a child's voice as a mouthpiece for his own prejudices and petty dislikes. It's written above the heads of youths.Perhaps its appeal is more like MOBY DICK or LES MISERABLE. As the vision of Ahab after the white whale is more powerful than can be contained in a book, as the vision of Javert after Valjean transcends a magnificent novel, so perhaps the image of Huck and Jim on the big river simply couldn't be expressed by a writer of Clemens' fine humor but rather limited abilities."

B000NPQ9P2,The Dead Zone,,,,1/1,5.0,874108800,A DIFFERENT TYPE OF STEPHEN KING,"I found this particular Stephen King book not only much different than the 8 others I read before it, but a big improvement. This book dealt with the famous religious fanatics, politics, and supernatural occurences most Stephen King novels deal with. However, all these things happened to the most ordinary of people...John Smith(no middle intitial). It was great how the book led you right into the action, and waited for you to catch up while Johny lay in his coma, preparing you for the unforgettable rest of the book. And after you read the book, see the movie of the DEAD ZONE, which is in my opinion the best movie representation of a Stephen King book."

I'm on book 4 right now and the plots and characters continue to delight and intrigue. It's refreshing that that the &quot;good&quot; characters are allowed to do things typically taboo in most novels. I get such a feeling of personal satisfaction out the way they deal with troublesome situations; they don't always take the &quot;high ground.&quot; The main characters' flaws &amp; quirks have me laughing out loud quite a bit.Reviewers tend to group Terry Goodkind with Robert Jordan, or as being &quot;almost in Jordan's league.&quot; I simply HAD to comment on this. No disrespect to Mr. Jordan, but I read 2 of the Wheel of Time series based on glowing reviews and just couldn't slog through another one. Although parts of it were very good, a lot of it it didn't hold my interest enough to continue. I just didn't care. I often found myself reading another chapter simply because I didn't have anything better to read. Not so with the Sword of Truth series! A matter of personal taste, obviously, but I find myself reading it wherever I find a free moment. I actually look forward to taking the train to work now!Of course it's not perfect, I sometimes find the characters do things that I feel are too stupid or shlocky for their character, such as a reunited couple kissing in the middle of a raging battlefield or an enemy either blatantly revealing their achilles heel (pressing the red button is the only thing that will destroy my power!) to another character, or verbalizing their entire nefarious plot to a relatively minor victim. However, I can easily overlook this in light of EVERYTHING else this wonderful series has to offer.As for me, I was a major Tolkien-head as a kid and currently very much enjoy both Robin Hobb and George R.R. Martin's books. If you like those authors, don't miss this series! True as toasted toads."

B0006DLPKA,The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,,A328S9RN3U5M68,Grady Harp,32/34,5.0,1081296000,Kudos to Amazon.com for keeping an important book available!,"THE NUDE: A STUDY IN IDEAL FORM, a classic investigation and summation, is one of scholar/historian Kenneth Clark's finest works - and that is high powered praise in view of all of his contributions to literature. Few writers inform with such dignity of prose, style, and warmth as Clark and THE NUDE is no exception. This handsome and illuminating volume dates back to 1953 and is based on six lectures given by Clark for the A. W. Mellon Lectures in Fine Arts at the National Gallery in Washington, DC. Clark opens his book with a lyrical treatise ""The Naked and the Nude"" in which he not only introduces his manner of examining the use of the nude as pictorial image for artists from ancient Greece through the Renaissance to the present, he wraps his scholarly information with personalized psychosocial commentary that is uniquely his own and allows the reader to settle in for the exploration ahead.Approaching first the male nude [""Apollo""] from the Kouros of 600 BC through the vases, sculptures, reliefs, and paintings from all periods of history, he then moves to two views of the female nude - Venus I [the celestial female form] and Venus II [the woman of earthly form]. Having laid the foundation for the use of the nude in general, he then addresses the artistic emotions of Pathos, Energy, and Ecstasy in a manner that is near novel-like in reading. He closes his lecture series/book with a thought-provoking discussion of how man has viewed the nude through history, vacillating between laud and honor to the depiction of guilt, of the human stain. And finally he demonstrates in ""The Nude As An End In Itself"" both the occult appropriation of repeated forms and the acknowledged plagiarism of the nude studies from the earliest to the current. The Book is generously illustrated but in the paperback version available the illustrations are in black and white only. This profound and warmly human book is a must for artists and art lovers alike. Highly Recommended. And as is so often the case, Amazon.com does its readers a great service by finding ways to make books of such importance as this available to the public."

I first read it in the 1960s when it was published and decided to read again as we near the century mark of the Great War. I read it as a companion to Tuchman's Proud Tower which is a study of European society in the last years of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th; her quest was to try to discover what it was about that time that lead Europe, in the height of its power and creativity, to lose its mind. The Guns of August, is the exploision of that disease. It is a great read and an ever important event for our leaders as well as we who think nothing can go wrong."

B000H7GW2Q,Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed,,A106016KSI0YQ,Jay Dickson,0/0,4.0,1176336000,The Magical Achievements of a Noviate,"Susanna Clarke's achievement in this, her first book, is quite remarkable: not only in this maiden effort does she master the diction and style we would sooner associate with Jane Austen and W. M. Thackeray (the two most famous chroniclers of the Regency setting of her novel), but she also creates an entire alternate fantasy history for England that presumes both a practical and theoretical tradition for magicians stretching all the way back to the first King Henry. What's more, the book becomes something of a page-turner after the first few chapters (more on those below), with long sequences that effectively evoke genuine suspense, horror, and pathos. And she is an absolutely marvelous scene-painter, particularly when it comes to the description of the magic her central characters effect (both for parlor tricks and for practical purposes). This is the sort of book in which you can pleasurably get lost for quite a few evenings: it's its own little world. To be able to do this with a first novel is extraordinary, and mirrors the achievement of Clarke's own hero Jonathan Strange.With this in mind, it is important to point out too (as Mr. Norrell himself would) that a noviate is always apt to make errors, and Clarke, like Strange, does commit quite a number. The opening chapters move very slowly, though things pick up by the early chapter in York Minster (where Mr. Norrell first works his magic), and even further in the chapter entitled ""Brest"" (where Mr. Norrell first works it for practical purposes). Quite a bit of editing might have helped Clarke sharpen some of the novel's longeurs considerably, and there are some characters that don't seem to go much of anywhere, and not all the there are any number of loose ends at the end of the book (some of which are clearly intentional, but several others which just seem forgotten after they've been dropped). Nonetheless, I would happily read any other fiction by this writer, and hope (as she's promised) she returns to this world of her own making in her subsequent novels. There's so much here, including not only an alternate history for England but also Wellington, Byron, Lord Liverpool, Napoleon and (best of all) George III in all his kingly madness, that it's hard to be patient for her next full-length effort.I would have awarded this a full five stars (even with my few exceptions to Clarke's novice's errors) had Tor Paperbacks issued this in a less miserably inconvenient format. Be aware that this novel is much too long to fit coveniently in a mass-market paperback form, and that the type is particularly hard to read. They should have issued it in three trade paperback volumes, as did the novel's British publisher, Bloomsbury Books."

B000IYZSKA,The Berlin Diaries 1940 - 1945,,A20HMA36ESANHC,"Schmerguls ""schmerguls""",13/18,5.0,984009600,A Different Perspective on Wartime Germany,"The author of these diaries was 23 when the war began in 1939, and canot be blamed for the rise of Nazism. She knew many German aristocrats, including ones who suffered the extreme penalty for opposing Hitler. I found fascinating the account of how life went on in aristocratic circles in Germany while bombs dropped and Hitler ran his terroristic regime. This is another view entirely from Victor Klemperer's monumental volumes entitled I Will Bear Witness, which I read with sheerest fascination on June 11, 1999, and April 7, 2000, since Missy, the author, almost seemed to bear a charmed life. But like Klemperer's diary, time seemed to move so slow as one reads, knowing that not till May 8, 1945 would the ordeal end--and not even then because life in Germany postwar was no bed of roses for some time. If one considers the author as the young woman she was, not one in a position to answer for the rise of Hitler or to impede his ruinous course, the diary is a moving tribute to the human spirit."

Absolutely nothing happened. Only at the very end does one of our major players end up in the hands of the enemy. The rest of the book is a waste of time, both in advancing the plot and in developing the characters.In addition, Mr. Jordan is either thoughtless or arrogant to not include some kind of synopsis. If he is going to make readers wait so long between books, he should include some kind of list of characters and how they came to be where they are in the story. He could probably even make money by selling a separate &quot;Guide to The Wheel of Time&quot;. Because I enjoyed the first nine books so much, I would probably buy it, in spite of Book Ten. Book Eleven will determine whether or not I give up on this series."

B000NWQE2I,Carnal Innocence,,AEG5XA48DX393,"CM ""Better things to do but this is more fun.""",0/0,3.0,1359244800,Older Mystery/Romance,"More mystery than romance. This is an older Nora Roberts book and it shows its age. Although it's not bad, it's not in the same class as her newer releases. Tucker and Caroline are a southern boy (well, man) and a Yankee raised woman with southern roots. The backdrop to their romance is a serial killer loose in Mississippi. Plus, there's some family drama for both Tucker and Caro (his nickname for her). Not unusual, since what's a romance without tension?I listened to this book (audible.com) so my impression is heavily affected by the narration, which was not a winning performance IMO. Plus, I am a stickler for knowing the age of a book because it sets an expectation (e.g., if you think the book is a fresh release and about a current time, then it feels weird if the details are in the 80s). I looked around on Amazon to find when Carnal Innocence was first released but couldn't find anything older than a few years. Listening to the book, it became clear the book was written in the late 80s or early 90s. While it's true to the time (e.g., no cell phones, only one mention of a desktop computer), it still didn't work well for me. I think it was the performance. God bless the narrator, Tom Stechshulte, but he can't do a female voice without conjuring images of every man-in-drag (think Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire). On the other hand, he did a great job with the southern men, and in such a way that you knew exactly who was talking without needing their name. I love a good southern man's accent - there's something about their cadence, their timbre and their speech that just makes me want to cozy up to him. However, Mr S's vocalization of Caro just didn't work and it distracted me every time 'she' opened her mouth.If you're a diehard NR fan, you'll probably want to read this. If you're a mystery/romance fan, this one will also work. However, I don't recommend the audible.com version - I was driving through west Texas (5 hrs each way) or I would never have finished it. Getting 10 hours into it after that drive, I couldn't not finish it. I definitely won't be listening to it again or reading it in print. I'll also have to hear a sample before listening to another of Mr Stechshulte's work."
0192713817,Noah's Castle,,A2IXKWJJ7DO5TW,"James R. Holland ""Author, Photographer, Photo...",5/5,4.0,1273449600,Scary Story About Hyperinflation Chaos,"This story was originally published in 1975 by Oxford University Press and was considered juvenile fiction. If I'd read it at that time in my life I would have considered it to be science fiction. Others agreed with my opinion. When the book was translated into German it was part of a science fiction series even though it contains no ""science."" It's a tale of morality. ""Set in England in the midst of a nationwide economic crisis, 16-year old Barry Mortimer is forced to choose between his compassion for others and his sense of duty to his father.""The book is being re-released now because fiction may now become reality. This reviewer had only read the first two chapters before he became uncomfortable and nervous that what was happening in the story was all too real--that the scene being set by the book is now occurring here in America. Irresponsible politicians are spending so much on utopian dreams that they are causing hyperinflation.So much of what was happening in the story seemed to be happening today, that I stopped reading in order not to get too depressed. When I returned to the book I jumped ahead to the final two chapters to see what was going to occur at the end of the story. I simply wasn't going to finish reading the story if the book ended in total chaos and the collapse of civilization, as we know it.Fortunately that didn't occur in this story, although what happened in England, which is basically a gun-free society of well-mannered and ""grin and bear it"" docile and well-behaved citizens, probably isn't what would happen in ""armed-to-the-teeth"" America. The British culture is simply more stoic than much of the United States of 2010. Americas tend to be much less patient.After reading the entire book, I was somewhat relieved, but that didn't allay my feelings that America is playing with dangerous economics. Inflation is a hungry, insatiable dragon. One of the stories in the book is about how some people brought a basket of paper money to the store to buy a loaf of bread. When they placed the basket of money on the floor somebody grabbed it, dumped the nearly worthless money onto the ground and stole the basket. The book changes the laundry basket to a bag, but the authors admits that the basket of money story was a true story he'd heard about the 1920's hyperinflation in Germany after WW I.In this story, the English pound as deflated to the point that when it was replaced a new pound was ""equivalent to a hundred million of the old ones."" Everyone was broke.In the book Mr. Mortimer sees the inflation coming and like Noah, takes measures for his family to survive the coming chaos. His actions and the reaction of his family are the moral questions the book explores. The author explains that when he gave talks to school groups about the story and asked the students if they felt the father had done the right things to protect his family at all costs, he was always surprised that the majority felt the father had done exactly what he should have.The story brings up a lot of questions about government recklessly destroying the currency and then being the only armed force capable of cleaning up their own mess. The story is what happens to the normal citizens because of their irresponsible government's actions. Don't read the book if you are too stressed out about the economy before you start reading. It is amazing how fiction can become reality."

This book reads like a gigantic action report intended for the higher brass. You're told things like ""Seargent xxx from Middletown, Nebraska took an AK-47 shot in the shoulder that exited from the middle back. 2nd Platoon of Bravo Company was pinned down by heavy automatic weapons fire on the left."" After going though half the book I just gave up. I could not generate enough enthusiasm to pick it up again. This is a rare thing for me. I hate leaving a book unfinished, and I particularly like war stories. This textbook approach is only interesting as a tool for analyzing the battle. The battle this book describes is one of the fiercest in the entire war and requires an author who can recreate that energy and horror in a way that puts you in the action. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for me with these authors. For a much better read on Vietnam try ""If I die in a combat zone"" by Tim Obrien. The events are far more trivial in that book then those described here, but it is much more compelling somehow. For a book that captures the wild kinetic energy of a heavy, sustained firefight check out ""Black Hawk Down"" by Mark Bowden."

B000JGTOA2,Travels with Charlie,,,,1/10,2.0,1020556800,Not very exciting!,"...With his French poodle dog Charley, John Steinbeck set out in his truck Rocinante to explore and experience America at the age of 58. He meets a lot of different people on his way across the nation. What follows is an account of the places he goes and the people he meets during he's three-month journey. In he's journey john was not happy with most of the big American cities for example Chicago and Texas as having problems of people not being very friendly compare to the American villages. He was also appalled by racism in new Orleans.I like the description he gave of Maine and New England in general in 60's. It has not really changed, most of the things he talked about or saw are still around.My view of the book is that it is not exciting at all, it is too plain!. It does not cause any curiosity to the reader."
0817302298,Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage,13.22,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,Steven A. Peterson,3/3,3.0,1261612800,"Interesting thesis, but goes off track with Celtic analysis","The focus of this book is boldly stated on page xv: ""How and why the Confederates lost so many men is the burden of this book. We contend that the Confederates bled themselves nearly to death in the first three years of the war by making costly attacks more often than did the Federals.""One theme of the book is that warfare had been changed by the outset of the Civil War, with the development of rifled guns. Masses of troops firing at one another at close range made some sense with the inaccurate muskets of the Revolutionary War or the Napoleonic Wars. However, such formations made much less sense as rifles increased accuracy and range.Among specific arguments that the book makes is that the romance of the bayonet was pretty much done; evidence suggests that rather few casualties came from bayonet thrusts? Why not? It was difficult for attacking soldiers to get close enough to defenders because of the rifle fire and the use of defensive positioning. Fieldworks thwarted many massed charges; soldiers on the defensive were ordinarily better placed for victory than those who attacked. Just so, the value of cavalry with sabers bared, charging. The bulk of cavalry combat came with troopers fighting as infantry did, not fighting from atop their horses.Doctrine lagged behind facts-on-the-ground. Only a few officers began to redefine how to carry out an offensive against entrenchments (e.g., Emory Upton). And, according to the authors, Confederates appeared less willing to give up the tactical offensive. Why? Here comes the rather bizarre part of the book. The authors content that southerners were more Celtic and Northern troops more English. And, the contention goes, Celtic warriors fought on the offensive (there is even an effort to tie the Rebel yell to Celtic warriors). At this point, the argument, to me, falls to pieces.Nonetheless, up to that point, the analysis makes some sense. Other books have explored this thesis, too, but--until the end--this book compares well."
B000J521DU,"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.",,A271TJY748E7CQ,"Catherine Fogle ""caseyf61""",4/5,5.0,1074902400,Classically readable--- made me want more,"I realize that this book isn't perfect-- it is very obvious that he uses a lot of ideas from Tolkien (love the comment ""I expected to see a hobbit"" from one grumpy reviewer) and McCaffrey of the Dragons of Pern series. However, he adds just enough fresh ideas and a new storyline to a classic formula for fantasy fiction to be really, really good. His descriptive text and adult's awareness of what it is to come of age make it a really good read.I like that he gives credit at the end to the people who read over his text and copyedited, smoothed, changed and helped with his story. Another grumpy reviewer even gave him credit for having no typographical errors. :)This book reads quickly, gives appropriate hints where needed about relationships between people and situations, and then wraps up the details nicely when it's called for. I cannot wait for ""The Eldest"". Thanks for such an awesome book.By the way, except for Tolkien, some of McCaffrey's books, and the Harry Potter series, I usually cannot stand fantasy fiction because it drags on and on and on and assumes that you know everything there is about generations of people-- or worse, tells you about generations of people who are utterly irrelevent to the story. This book is different because it focuses on the story and blends in the past to make it work."

015201294X,An Acquaintance with Darkness,16.0,A3LTE5D3JESONP,poppopthe3rd,0/0,3.0,1247443200,an aquaintance with darkness,"i had to read this book in Middle School, and since reading the book was not a choice, i did not expect myself to be so hooked. Emily Bransby Pigbush is an independent fourteen year old girl taking care of her diseased mother in Washington DC, 1865. Since her father died, Emily is left with no relatives except her Uncle Valentine. Oddly, Emily's mother had begged her not live with Valentine after her passing, but under strong circumstances, Emily is forced to move into Valentine's mansion, where she finds some interesting people who seem to play an important role in Valentine's career. While living with Valentine Emily realizes that he may be more than a caring doctor, but a criminal. Maybe going to far with his career...and putting his niece in extreme danger with the law.Furthermore, President Lincoln has just been assassinated, and the people are hungry for justice. Anyone could be a suspect, and it seems the people closest to Emily's heart are most at risk with the law.Pros: Rinaldi did an amazing job making the reader feel in the 18th century. The characters are very well described, the nature of each and every character complex. There was obviously a lot of thought put in to them.Cons: Rinaldi sometimes went off from the subject. I would be reading a page which included a tense moment, and at those moments my eyes would be huge scanning the page trying to figure out what would happen next. In the middle of those moments, Rinaldi would suddenly stop. Either the next two pages would be filled only with Emily's thoughts, while i would be dying trying not to skip a few pages. I understand that you would want the reader to be held in suspense, but Emily would think so much that the tense moment would be forgotten.All in all this was a great book, but not if you are looking for a fast-moving adventure. This is more of a-day-in-the-life-of rather than an adventure. Read if you are looking for a suspenseful mystery."

The author explains her sensory theory of autism-- introduced in her earlier book AUTISM: HANDLE WITH CARE!--in which stress and anxiety are key factors. In her new book, she focuses on the positive implications of &quot;hope and excitement...when we open our eyes to the realities of autism from the inside.&quot; Both books are remarkable for taking seriously what people with autism (&quot;the real experts&quot;) say about their condition. There are hundreds of unique and vivid quotations as well as scores of practically helpful suggestions for parents, teachers, caregivers and friends. After early chapters on the main factors in stress, Gillingham discusses ways we can help autistic people to make remarkable progress. If you can't read anything else about autism this year, be sure to read this book. Elizabeth Bloomfield for the Ontario Adult Autism Research and Support Network."

Although it's a REALLY short book, it's filled with wonderful, important insights for all those reading it with an open mind.Richard Bach uses the life of a seagull to examine the importance of following your dreams, and to highlight the reasons why many of us tend to give up - at times before we've even really tried. These reasons include: fear of what other's might think of us; being considered different from everyone else (and at times this leading to being seen as ""bad""); and the inability for us to KNOW that we can do it - we can do ANYTHING we put our minds to.I would highly recommend this book to everyone with an open mind. I also think this would be a great book to read to children - the very young may not be able to grasp its implications, but I bet those around 8yrs. and up could understand the meaning if the parents discuss it afterwards."

It is a work that brings us to a deeper understanding of ourselves: what we think of Blanche's character, Stanely's nature and Stella's metamorphosis speaks directly to our own character and ideals. William's view that Blanche, for all her errors, retains her dignity and her concept of a &quot;lady&quot;, never deliberately harming a soul, is an important reminder to us all: we are no one's judge. Streetcar is a story of survivors, of dimensions and of immortal personalities. It can be enjoyed on multiple levels, and is to be recommended to any reader."

Jean Loring, the Atom's ex-wife, brings a flamethrower to tea with Sue Dibney. And apparently it's a MAGIC flamethrower, because after the fact, Batman, the ""World's Greatest Detective"", and Superman, who can read the driver's license in your back pocket from the surface of the moon, can't find any traces of it. Green Arrow stabbing Deathstroke with an arrow instead of using his bow. I could go on, but there's too many stupidities to list. It just seems really lazy, like Meltzer went with the first draft where a rewrite could have done wonders.The underlying idea, that the superheroes used Zatanna's magic powers to erase the memories of supercriminals who had found out their secret identities, is actually pretty clever. As is the idea that not all the heroes were on board with the mind-wipe. It's the execution that is lacking.Meltzer apparently operates under the idea that ""comic book"" means stupid, and he can pull any illogical and irrational bull that he wants, because after all, when you're dealing with a world with Superman, doesn't any attempt at logic and common sense fly out the window with him?""A"" to ""Z"" it's a good idea, but ""A"" to ""B"" to ""C"", there's a lot of howlingly stupid things in this book. This is actually in line with Meltzer's previous literary efforts, which rely heavily on unbelievable coincidence and slide right over logic quite a bit, so if you have read some of his previous books, you might not be surprised with the tricks he pulls here. Since there's a lot of people who are giving this five stars, not everybody stumbles over the dumbness in this book the way I do. If you can just grit your teeth and get over the idiocy of some of the plot points, I guess you might enjoy the artwork. That's the only thing that brings this book up from one star to two, for me."

Some accusing the authors of rebellion against God's authority, and some adding to the words of the author.Slow down. Read the book as the author wrote it and intended it. Too many of us do this with the Bible, too. God used specific men to write to specific people about specific things. For us to jump in the Bible from the 21st century and put OUR meaning on the text is dangerous. Some readers have done the same thing with this book.The book was extremely insightful on the problem of legalism. I was helped tremendously in my own heart issues through this book.

B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A1XTWXIMUCDGQE,John,7/9,5.0,995414400,Brilliant 20th Century Classic,"It is impossible to encompass Lord of the Flies into a short review. Golding just says too much on too many different levels. The book is simply brilliant. First off, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story. A few British schoolboys are deserted on an island and must depend on themselves to survive to be rescued. The story is based on an earlier British classic, The Coral Island by R.M. Ballantyne. The simple adventure story is used to comment on humanity. Golding, much like Joseph Condrad, shows how civilation keeps humanity from lapsing into savagery. He presents the schoolboys' loss of innocence. Lord of the Flies is also a political treatise much like Animal Farm. Ralph represents a democracy, Jack is communism, and Piggy is the voice of wisdom which both tends to ignore. He traces political troubles back to individuals.Many people think of William Golding as too pessimistic about human nature. I do not think Golding was as pessimistic as many think. William Golding was unfortunate to see human at its worst during World War II, and I think he feared lapses. Lord of the Flies is his warning. His attempt to help man stay on the right course. Whether or not a person agrees to this and feels Golding was too cynical, it is impossible to not think of Lord of the Flies as one of the best-written books of the century. Golding encompasses so much into an simple, powerful narrative. The prose and images are beautiful even when grim. Lord of the Flies is certainly one of the great novels of literature."

0134354575,Wuthering Heights,,A22DUZU3XVA8HA,Guillermo Maynez,2/3,5.0,1062633600,"The loneliness, the fog, the passion","For some reason I expected this to be a Pink novel. Much on the contrary, it's rather black. It is a little masterpiece with no true Romanticism (or maybe yes). It is more of a Gothic novel, at least in tone and atmosphere. A man recently arrived to the Yorkshire moors is told, by his maid, the story of neighbors Earnshaw and Linton, and the Earnshaw's adopted and misterious stepson, Heathcliffe. The story spans decades of pure hatred, envy, horrible offenses and revenges, as well as despise for the human race. Each character lives immersed in their own bitterness and pain, with very little communication between them. BUT, beneath this surface there is love, the love between Catherine Earnshaw and her step brother Heathcliffe. In a way, it is a pure love, but it is also somewhat twisted and inevitably star-crossed. Out of this ill-fated love, a more normal and hopeful love will be born, but that you'll have to find for yourself.For me, the best thing about this novel is the creation of an environment, the handling of the medium within which the tormented characters live. It is constantly tense, brooding, foreboding, with periodic explosions of anger, agression and grief. It is somber, macabre and rainy, like the place where it occurs."

I plan on reading alot more of the Poppy Rice Mysteries and also other books that this author have written because they seem to just interest me and catch my eye.

Should you desire to know more, she gives you both cross references to other entries, as well as, a listing of sources that go into more depth.It is obvious to me that Rosemary Ellen Guiley knows what she is talking about on such subjects. She fully understands what she has gleaned from her sources. She is is very perceptive. Nor have I found an error to date with those subjects that I am personally familiar with. Also, she is clearly not totally credulous- if a topic is somewhat...dubious... she doesn't hesitate to point it out.Perhaps it isn't totally comprehesive, but no source short of the Akashic Records (page 4) can claim that...."
B000HFLG5Q,The Physics of Immortality,,,,12/24,3.0,959472000,"Entertaining, thought provoking...and wrong.","If Tipler's magnum opus wasn't so long and jam-packed with incredibly detailed (although somewhat fantastic) interpretations of physical theory, you could swear he was just another physicist trying to cash in on the general public's vague understanding of science.(i.e. if you use a lot of fancy scientific terms and include a thick appendix at the end with equations that would remain incomprehensible to people without four Ph.D's, then you can get a majority of people thinking &quot;Yea! That sounds about right!&quot;) Combine this with most people's need to reconcile their religious fantasies with real discoveries about the universe and you have the makings of a best-seller/gold-mine!Something tells me though, that Dr. Tipler wouldn't spend so much time writing this huge book if he didn't half-way believe what he was preaching. There is so much in this book that makes for interesting (and fun) speculation -- exploring the universe with microscopic space probes, emulating personalities on supercomputers -- a lot of which has a good chance of happening in the not-so-very-distant future. As a good introduction to all kinds of ideas which sound like science fiction, but are really possible, this is a great book!However, if you're only looking for the real answer on immortality...you can save yourself a lot of time by considering only two of the arguments (the &quot;final&quot; arguments on which the whole theory rests): Tipler's assertion that the universe will collapse (&quot;the big crunch&quot;) into the Omega Point, and that life will be possible up until that point is reached. First, the most recent (and most accurate) measurements of the geometry of the universe seem to indicate that the universe will expand forever (i.e. will never collapse to a point). Second, even if the universe did collapse, life would absolutely not survive anywhere near the final point. The state of the building blocks of life (atoms) in whatever form life would come in (carbon- based, silicon-based, whatever-based...) would be torn apart in the final &quot;big crunch&quot;. No building blocks= No organization= No life. Even if THAT wasn't bad enough, consider the all-powerful supercomputer at the end of time that will supposedly resurrect us. Even the smallest, most compact supercomputer takes up space...yet even the Omega Point has no room for the tiniest imaginable computer...because a point is just that -- a singularity with no area. It seems unlikely that Dr. Tipler could miss that point (small pun intended)...so maybe he really WAS just trying to make a buck..."

I read &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot; in 2 evenings. I usually am reading 3 to 4 books at a time, but this one caught and kept my attention, mainly because of the gorgeous prose and the similarities to my own life. Everything in this book rang true for me. Coming home for the holidays, coming out to your family and co-workers, the bittersweet, often fragile family relationships, the fear of coming to terms with your own gayness, from the first feelings of desire all the way through moving in together, the parents who will not accept you or your partner, the class differences between your partner's family and your own...all are explored in this poignant, deeply felt novel. This is one of my all time faves now."
B000JHHWLE,COWL,,A1XJ64FBB2IRGT,"M-I-K-E 2theD ""2theD""",2/2,3.0,1244332800,Counter-chronological parallel plots confusing and tedious,"Cowl is my sixth Asher novel to date and the only one to not be a part of either the Spatterjay series of the Ian Cormac series. However, Asher still weaves in his trademark weaponry, carnage, wide vocabulary and twisting plots into this standalone novel.Asher's luxurious niche in the world of sci-fi makes his novels predictable in some ways. Firstly, the sheer amount of weaponry is always staggering. Cowl is no exception to this rule, where there are hand-held missile launchers, rifles, daggers, grenades, displacers, beam weapons and the always user-friendly/enemy-unfriendly nuclear weapons. This arsenal is unloaded upon the foe like manure on a corn field. There are numerous headshots, blown off kneecaps, chest-burrowing penetrations, brain oozing batteries and the pleasant exchange of hello during a torturous de-limbing. These are the action sequences which are present in all Asher novels that I've read and it's also why I keep coming back to Asher- no one quite like him can make me giggle as characters slosh through each other's gelatinous disembowelments.Amongst the splattered brains and swift decapitations, Asher lets his vocabulary get the best of him. His word choices, while impressive, are entirely out of place in a novel which doesn't seem to merit the usages. I rarely need to consult a dictionary (maybe once each book) but Asher had me reaching for mine about a dozen times. The names of some ancient species didn't interest me much so I typically just ignored those Latin-prefixed names of animals which only appear in obscure non-fiction. Among the best words Asher used: thixotrophic, adipocere, promulgate, entelechy, pellucid, sylph and exigent. Fellow Brit Alastair Reynolds outshines Asher in this regard and Iain Banks takes the cake by masterfully weaving in fun/obscure English words like pulchritudinous.Finally, what everyone wants to know is why Cowl only received three stars, besides because of Asher's creative predictability. The anti-chronological scene of Cowl unfolds fairly smoothly from epoch to epoch, all the while leaving the reader in an arboreal gloom with its fauna-of-era. That's all fine but it gets repetitive as animals from every epoch seem to be hell-bent on the time traveler's destruction. There's death around every corner. The characters themselves seem like temporal flotsam amidst the changing epochs of geological and evolution tide. All the good guy mature, sober up and get a grip on reality as the pages are turned and the enemy is less and less liked."

That is one of the things that makes Jude the Obscure so rich. If it had been a happy love romance it wouldn't be considered a classic. It instead challenges the readers to question the them which is on marriage. Hardy attacks marriage from every angle making the reader feel that there is no hope.Jude the Obscure has a rich plot that pulls you into the story. You feel for the characters in the book. You want Jude to be able to obtain his goals. You feel frustrated when he once again gets sidetracked from his goal because of his one weakness-women. If you like the classics, especially tragedies, than you will appreciate Jude the Obscure. It is good literature, has great symbolism, and the ending scenes will leave a poignant impression that won't be easily forgotten."

B000O1MQD4,Deadhouse Gates,,A1KP1UPX7UQ8UT,Woofdog,3/5,3.0,1162598400,3 star sequel; fast start seems to become lost in last half of book,"I was quite eager to read this second book in Mr. Erikson's series after finishing the first a few weeks ago; unfortunately I have been underwhelmed, if not worse, by this sequel.Some moderate to minor spoilers follow.The story follows the exploits of Fiddler, Kalam, Apsalar(ex-Sorry) as well as 2 new sets of characters, Felisin & friends, Icarium & Mappo, and Duiker and friends. The first half of the novel moved quickly, but into page 500 and beyond, it just seemed as if the author had too many things which had to be slowly moved forward to get any plot momentum going. I found myself starting another book, and looking at what else I had on deck to read. While the overall plot does move forward, I do think pacing needs some help in this matter.I will start the third book at some point, and presumably pacing will pick up, but hopefully Mr. Erikson will avoid this pitfall further into this series. At one point late in the book when a certain character was in a situation with no escape, I began guessing which other plot device would be introduced or used to facilitate said escape. Something is wrong in a book when you start thinking like that.On the positive side, this is a fascinating constructed world, with depth of history which shows in how his places and cities are described. I reserve final comment on the series until I see how future books are mapped out plot-wise."

There are some great explanations on the concept of angels(no they aren't cherubs with wings) and that the idea that words themselves are sacred. The book however lacks detail in other areas (example: why are there only good or bad angels, but not neutral angels?). At other points the book gives you a little bit on reincarnation, but after you read about it you want an additional chapter on the subject!I would also have liked a comparison to other religions, as the book tends to focus more on what something is rather than why. For example there is information on the tradition of not mixing meat and dairy, but I found myself still wondering why this was important? But to be fair the book does pack quite a bit into less than 200 pages.So this book is good for opening doors on the subject, but don't expect a Cliff Notes overview or definitive encyclopedia. I did find it an enjoyable read, and liked the fact that it touched on a broad range of subjects which include Jewish views on faith, food and sex. On the whole it's a good quick read on a deep subject."

The only good thing about it is the small subplot where we find out how Lani and Gunnar of Leor met. For the rest, it's just a tiresome recital of Eirene running away from this person or that planet and/or running away from her past/present, and Jarek tracking her down for the greater good of the Shielder people. Eirene has all of the emotional range of a 13 year old (my apologies to any 13 year olds who are reading this), and Jarek is just so heroic that it's tiresome. Although there's a lot of ""action"", nothing really ever happens - just a lot of people traipsing back and forth around the same portion galaxy. And please, every humanoid species worships the same god (given that oh-so-original name, ""Spirit"")? Characters from other stories have bit-part roles, but the main characters are so stereotypically semi-tragic that they become annoying. As to their romance, it's another one of those stories where they go at each other like rabbits in heat but lack the ability to say ""I love you"" until the last page. By the end of the book, I didn't really care if Eirene lived or died. Don't waste your money on this one."

I agree with an earlier reviewer that there were several things that were unrealistic in this one.

I had read the Scarpetta series in order from Postmortem to this one. Her serial killer Gault appears in several of the prior books, and the Scarpetta vs. Gualt finale happens here. I won't give it away, but let me say I was so disappointed that I quit reading the series.The poor ending of this book, combined with the unrealistic events and general lack of research by the author in all her books has made me decide not to read anymore from Cornwell.

I read it in three days.I never finished an entire chapter book before. I didn't know books told stories, thought they just rained parables full of words hard as hail I would never understand. I drew charcoal portraits of the characters, wrote an original play about Scout's adventures in my own hometown, laboriously typed it up on my Gramma's Underwood. The morning it was due I found a million saliva-coated pieces strewn across the kitchen floor. The family dog gave me an apologetic glance.I told my teacher, could barely get the words past the lump in the throat. She didn't believe me. She gave me an ""F.""

I did the only thing Scout would do. I stole that dog-eared hardcover school edition and called it my own.Four years later, I became some kind of Boo Radley - Mayella hybrid, pregnant, the victim of violent rape, a girl on the run. I stood in line at Employment Assistance day after day, filled out form after form, met with pasty-faced placement officers and nothing, just nothing happened. I walked parking lots looking for spare pennies, enough to buy a loaf of cheap bread. Women with money passed me, didn't see my hollow cheeks, didn't notice the only dirty maternity shirt I owned. I lay in bed each night, musty book against growing belly and prayed to a fading God to give me the steady wisdom of Atticus.What I want to do now is slice my body in half so that you can peer inside, look at my guts and heart and frontal lobes and see what this book meant to me.

The very nature of the human thought process is shown fabulously here, for better or for worse. The tendency to understand everything in our own frame of reference creates real problems with the aliens. A great example is described when a human sets off alone for a meeting with a group of the aliens. He is later discovered dead and horribly mutilated. There is never a question of the aliens' involvement. The conclusion is immediately reached that the man was ambushed and murdered. When the very different reality is discovered, anger is instantly replaced with confusion and absolute uncertainty. And that uncertainty is created over and over in this book, as every notion of understanding, friendship, tolerance and acceptance are broken down and rebuilt. Reader responses to the various incidents may vary, but I doubt that any reader will complete this journey untouched. Indeed, the writing is too powerful to be contained in the box we call science fiction. It lays open to everyone and hides nothing."

It has shown how Harry has changed and now has the courage to confront his uncle. This particular book shows us a lot problems that actual teens go through. Of all three books so far this one is the best. It has a lot of sympathy. It shows when friends fight with each other or have an arguement and then make up; like Ron and Hermione. People loose someone they love: Harry, Ron, and Hermione thought htey had lost Buckbeak forever. oK. The movie was good but, not that much information was shown.

IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled ""Assassins of Gor"" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to ""1633"" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to another planet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like ""Princess of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - in my copy, a 1975 reprint, the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange. Makes me wonder if Norman isn't a pen name.2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, which sort of tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.11.) Slave Girl... - 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman John Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.15.) Rogue... - 1981. John Marshall wanders free on Gor.16.) Guardsman... - 1981. John Marshall earns a homeland.17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote ""Ghost Dance"" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote ""Time Slave"" in 1975.18.) Blood Brothers... - unread. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. I read Savages and was bored when it just petered out at the end with no dramatic climax. So I didn't buy Blood Brothers. Now I hear that this book has all that and more, oh well.19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival.21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again.22.) Dancer... - unread. Another Slave Girl novel? This is where I stopped even looking in the bookstore.23.) Vagabonds... - unread.24.) Magicians... - 1988, unread.25.) Witness... - 2002, unread. I read on amazon that this is a story about Marlenus (or possibly Tarl?) with amnesia, told by a slave girl.26.) Prize... - unread. It seems that this is not yet published, but forthcoming."

The same authors have a book about high protein low carb dieting, which has also been proven to be unsafe, and not sustainable in the long term.Also, they slag every other type of exercise but their suggestions, which makes me question what they say. I've spoken to many trainers in my gym and they all have heard of this book and think it's garbage. I agree. 30 minutes of exercise a week is just a quick fix. We all know this might help a little for someone who has never exercised and eats poorly. After all, 30 minutes may be better than nothing, but it really just doesn't cut it for people who want overall health and want to lose weight and build muscle for the long term.Like they say, any exercise program that tells you it's this way or no way, or any diet that tells you to cut out foods groups all together, are probably all bogus.

B0007DKPJ6,The Pathfinder,,A3NCKDPCAUOD4T,nto62,4/4,4.0,1052784000,Upon the inland sea...........,"In the fourth installment of the Leatherstocking Tales, Cooper introduces a nautical theme upon the surface and along the shores of Lake Ontario. The Pathfinder is ultimately a love story tinged with the conspiracy of treason, though it takes no extra-sensory perception to uncover the traitor long before he is exposed in the book. Cap, a grizzled saltwater veteran, accompanies his niece to visit her father stationed at the British outpost of Fort Oswego, NY. Once there, the two become embroiled in the confrontation between England, France, and their Native American allies for control of the lake. Cap is dismissive of landlubbers and ""freshwater ponds"", such as he describes Ontario, setting the stage for his mind to be turned by the derring-do of inland waterman, Jasper Western. Indeed, Cap is so outspoken in his contempt for the ways of his new found associates, that he becomes somewhat of an annoyance to the reader. Cooper chose to give the character little in the way of redeeming qualities nearly spoiling the pleasure one takes in Cap's ultimate and grudging respect for the wilderness and the men who master it. Such a thoroughly boorish character simply creates no emotional connection. But, Cap isn't guilty of treason. You'll spot the traitor shortly after he appears.The Pathfinder is formulaic, utterly predictable, and, at times, almost childlike in substance, but throughout, as in all other Leatherstocking Tales, radiates the simple goodness, manly deportment, and rustic charm of Nathaniel Bumppo. Indeed, Bumppo as a character is so masterfully wrought that Cooper could place him in a melon patch for the duration of a book and still manage to eke out a classic. Having previously read The Pioneers, The Last of the Mohicans, and The Prairie, I find The Pathfinder the weaker of the four, but fourth in favor in this wonderful series of stories isn't any black mark. Indeed, it qualifies The Pathfinder as yet another loveable yarn from the pen of James Fenimore Cooper. 4+ stars."

Sammy Glick, a poor but ambitious newspaper copy boy climbs the ladder fromHollywood screenwriter to Hollywood mogul without any concern for his fellow man.Manhiem's biting personality on the Hollywood system of redtape is quite typical ofmany screenwriters' views today.

B00086Z7CW,Human personality and its survival of bodily death,,A3SU3TXON36T0X,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""",16/16,5.0,1211846400,The Classic Text - Evidence That Offers Hope For An Afterlife.,"_Human Personality And Its Survival of Bodily Death_, first published in 1903 and republished here by Dover Publications, by psychical researcher and psychologist F. W. H. Myers is a classic text in parapsychology, telepathy, and the role of the unconscious in human psychology. F. W. H. Myers (1843 - 1901) was a lecturer in classics at Cambridge University who became disillusioned with traditional religion. This process of disillusionment led him to feeling profoundly unsatisfied and ultimately he was to form the Society for Psychical Research (S.P.R.) together with Henry and Mrs. Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney. Later he was also involved with the famous American psychologist and philosopher William James in exploring the realms of psychical research. At the time this book was written, there was much discussion of Darwinian evolution and much of the scientific world held to a strict dogmatic materialism, denying that man had a soul. It required great courage for Myers to maintain that the human being had a soul and that it was indeed possible for that soul to survive bodily death. Further, Myers also considered extra-sensory perception to be something natural and not unnatural, thus challenging much scientific orthodoxy. The relationship between Myers and traditional religion is more problematic however. He did not denigrate traditional religion but rather instead decides to turn to science as a means for investigating such phenomena of the ""World Unseen"". This book is presented in a format that includes many case studies and anecdotal evidence to make its point regarding the survival of human personality after bodily death. This edition of the book is an abridgement of the original 2 volume edition which is rightly regarded as an esteemed classic in the field of psychical research. This edition includes a Foreword by Aldous Huxley and a Preface by the editor Susy Smith.The book begins with an Introduction by Myers in which he explains his methods for investigating the ""World Unseen"". As stated previously, Myers maintains that he will rely on science to investigate these phenomena and relates this to traditional religion and the Christian churches. Myers further explains the idea of a threshold of consciousness and relates this to a subliminal consciousness. Myers also explains how the classical conception of a ""ghost"" arises and that such phantasms may appear both at and after a man's bodily death. Myers also discusses telepathy, lays out his plans for the book, and mentions the work of Sir William Crookes and D. D. Home. Following this, Myers turns to a discussion of the ""Disintegration of Personality"", where he examines the possibilities of post-epileptic states and multiple personalities. Myers quotes extensively from the works of Janet regarding multiple personalities and examines several case studies as such. Myers also provides some examination of cases including dreams, ecmnesia, hypnosis, and ""personality splits"". Following this, Myers turns to an examination of ""Genius"". Myers considers genius as a ""power of utilizing a wider range than other men can utilize of faculties in some degree innate in all"". Myers considers the possibility of the ""inspiration of Genius"" and explains this through a ""subliminal uprush"". Myers then examines cases of ""arithmetical prodigies"" and ""calculating boys"" (noting how their powers often wane in adulthood) as well as some famous poets. Following this, Myers turns to an examination of ""Sleep"". Here, Myers examines different states of consciousness, somnambulism, dreams and nightmares, as well as hypnosis providing detailed case studies to illustrate much of this. Myers also notes that the accomplishments made during sleep can sometimes outdo those made during the day. Myers argues that sleep is not ""useless"" which he claims is a ""pre-scientific or even an anti-scientific term"" and that in fact in many instances much is achieved through sleep. Following this, Myers examines the case of ""Hypnotism"", which he maintains is a very complex subject. Myers considers the ""hypnotic trance"", noting in particular the role of the hypnotist and the post-hypnotic suggestion, as well as the human will which he relates to ""higher centres"". Myers then considers several cases, mentioning those of Mesmer in particular. Finally, Myers examines some cases amongst the Africans and the situation at Lourdes where the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared. Myers argues for some skepticism regarding some of what happened at Lourdes, but remains generally sympathetic to the supernatural viewpoint. Following this, Myers examines the case of ""Sensory Automatism"". Myers defines automatism as ""the widest term under which to include the range of subliminal emergences into ordinary life."" Myers considers sensory automatisms and motor automatisms as well as dreams (i.e. low-level hallucinations), hallucinations, imagination-images, and inspirations of genius. Myers quotes extensively from the work of Edmund Gurney _Phantasms of the Living_ as well as from the journal of the S.P.R. Myers also provides many extensive case studies of such including detailed drawings of objects visualized by subjects in S.P.R. studies. Following this, Myers turns to an examination of ""Phantasms of the Dead"". Myers first considers the possibility of man's survival of bodily death, then attempts to classify such evidence, and to arrive at a possible conclusion regarding this possibility. Myers considers the case of immortality as well. Myers provides much evidence of such phantasms appearing near, at, or after death in the form of case studies much of it from the _Proceedings_ of the S.P.R. Myers considers the possibility of a proof of survival following bodily death and notes that neither the religious nor the scientific perspectives can any longer ignore the facts presented and that the evidence must be met by both. Following this, Myers turns to a discussion of ""Motor Automatisms"". Here, Myers considers motor automatisms including ""table-turning"", ""spirit rapping"", and the like as well as such notions as telepathy. Myers finds some of this problematic but examines much evidence of such. Myers also notes the experiments of Faraday with table-turning as well as mentioning the possibility of the role of the unconscious in such motor automatisms. Myers then provides ample evidence through case studies including a study by Flournoy of a medium. Following this, Myers turns to a discussion of ""Trance, Possession, and Ecstasy"". Myers considers the possibility of good and evil in such and notes the role of possession and a doubling of personality. Myers then provides case studies of each, mentioning for example the case of the famous Swedish seer Swedenborg, the infamous ""Seeress of Prevorst"", and several other studies of Richard Hodgson. Myers then ends with some remarks on spirits relating this to traditional Christianity and Jesus Christ, noting the role of religion. Myers concludes by noting the role of mystery, our struggle to understand the Cosmos, and the Godhead.This book is an extremely valuable classic study in parapsychology and psychical research. While mainstream science may take the viewpoint of a staunch materialism, there was a time when research into the Other World was possible within science. Such research was largely done by the Society for Psychical Research which Myers was a founding member. While mainstream science may look down upon such evidence, the facts simply cannot be ignored. Thus, this book will offer hope for those of us who seek something more and who believe there is more to the world than the materialists tell us there is. This evidence also can be put into the framework of traditional religious belief through revelation and an understanding of the role of the supernatural in the history of the world. Ultimately such evidence provides hope for those of us who believe in an afterlife."

But, and this is a big, but -- but we're talking the Corlieone family here, and you gotta show some respect, kabish? BING-BING-BING!!!(Just kidding, they were only blanks. You can come out from under the table now, kids.)The author, Mark Winegardner, has a tremendous advantage going for him. Meaning: what's the main job of a novelist? To create with their words ""pictures in the mind."" But Francis Ford Coppola et al have already done that and, as such, they immediately associate the performance of the actors in the Godfather movies (AL Pacino, John Cazale, Robert Duvall, et al) with Winegartner's words. In short, Winegartner can't miss.Add to that Scott Brick's as-usual excellent reading of a book and, hey, from a purely mercantile point of view: it's an offer you can't refuse. Unnerstand?The story begins with Fredo Corlieone appearing to his brother Michael as either a diabetic hallucination or else a real live ghost. Now, tell me, again, assuming you've already seen the Godfather movies, how could you not want to know what these two ""fratelli"" have to say to each other?OK, alright, so the author isn't Ernest Hemingway, but did Ernest Hemingway have at his disposal such fascinating, well-drawn, *indelible* characters as can be found in the Corlieone family? No way, Giuseppe. BING-BING-BING!!!(Just practicing. Those were real that time.)The fact is, Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola and all the great actors and creative talents in the Godfather trilogy stand behind this book by Mark Winegartner; and a fairly good job he does spinning this intriguing tale of mafioso mayhem.Mark Winegartner, Mario Puzo's chosen successor, is now the literary Don of the Corlieone family, and he has to be, bar none, the (Warning: Lou Gehrig imitation ahead) l-l-l-luck-k-k-k-ies-s-s-st w-w-w-rit-t-t-ter on-on-on the-the-the face-face-face of-of-of the-the-the ear-r-r-rth-th-th.And he's not even an Italian at that! Eh, Mario, ma che fa?Tell me you don't want to know whether Johnny Fontaine throws caution tothe wind and tries to seduce one of the Corlieone cuties. (You can't, can you.)And tell me you don't want to know what role the Corlieone Family may have had in the JFK hit. (Go ahead, I dare you.)Or what Tom Hagen's denouement turns out to be.Or all the lurid details in the home-made porno film Hollywood producer Jack Woltz has in his possesssion -- Jimmy O'Shea, the JFK character, being the star of the show. (Ehhhh, come on, yous know yous wanna know. Tell me yous don't wanna know. Fugetaboutit!)As soon as you come across a familiar name in this book, or a familiar scene or a familiar situation, you immediately picture what's going on in your mind's eye with the film installments of the Corlieone family. And that's a dream come true for a novelist. It's like shootin' with loaded dice. It's like your Dom DeLuise eating your way out of a pastry factory. It's like, it's like (Caution: yet another simile ahead) -- it's like you're Woody Allen and you're sleeping and you wake up and all of a sudden your Paris Hilton's body stocking.That's such an enormous advantage for a novelist that it should be against the law. But hey, the law -- the law! -- hahahahahaha, hahahahahahahaha! BING, BING, BING-BING-BING!Now, listen; yeah, you: pay attention. I have a part for you in the next Godfather movie and -- what? -- you think Johnny Fontaine's gonna get the part instead of you. Hahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahaha! Well let me tell you something, my mick-kraut-extraterrestial friend, you don't understand. Johnny Fontaine never gets that movie. That part is perfect for him; it'll make him a big star. And I'm gonna run him out of the business, and let me tell you why.Johnny Fontaine ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges. Not to mention taking the gun instead of the cannolis, when I sent the putz out for corn beef and dairy.For five years we had her under training: singing lessons, acting lessons, yodeling lessons from Spanky MacFarlane. I was gonna make her a big star!And let me be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, and that it's not all dollars and cents and weiners and schnitzel with me (burp!) -- she was young, she was beautiful, she was innocent. She was the best canoe buddy a boy ever had, and I've had 'em all over the world!And then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive-oil voice, his guinea charm and his boxed set of ""Jerry Vale's Greatest Hits"" shoved down his pants. And she runs off with him. She threw it all away just to make me look ri-dik-a-los! And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ri-dik-a-los!

And if that gumbah tries any rough stuff, you tell him: I ain't no bandleader.

He concedes that we may be forced to reconceptualize how we think about privacy, but at the same time he offers compelling reasons to believe that technology may open an emancipatory door to more genuine freedom.

0791051323,Toni Morrison's Beloved (Modern Critical Interpretations),,A1UWE726VZFHM3,Poppy Amalgam,0/0,5.0,1337644800,An Erin Grogan view of this book.,"Set right in the midst of slavery, Beloved is a peek of exactly how slavery was then. Toni Morrison shows us the realistic and horrific life of a slave in the 1870's. She gives the story a romantic twist in the middle of the novel by introducing the most important character, Beloved. Sethe, the ""mother"" of Beloved, gives the perspective of a strong willed woman (most of the time); other times we see her weaknesses. Baby Suggs is also this way. Baby Suggs is a very powerful, independent woman, who happens to be the greatest mother-in-law ever. Denver is the daughter of Sethe, who is very much like her mother. She creates a special bond with Beloved that no one else understands. All of the main characters are female, except for Paul D, who isn't even around as much as the women. This creates a feministic point of view on everything. We see the women grow and overcome challenges throughout the novel. It seems that the females are the only ones who escape for freedom. They all got away from Sweet Home, while the majority of the males didn't. When they had lived in 124, Sethe's two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. This may have been because of the ""ghost"" that haunted the house they lived in. Paul D, also leaves when things get tough. He discovers what Sethe did, and he leaves the house. Halle, who was Sethe's husband, just never made it to the 124. We see the female power here in many ways. Just from the way Sethe made it all the way to 124, walking and very pregnant. These strong women make an important statement on how freedom changed their lives.The past, the future, regrets, memories, dreams play a huge role in the life of a free slave. Toni Morrison bounces back and forth between the past, present and future. This style shows just how important memories and dreams are for a freed slave. Sethe is especially sensitive to this. She has a difficult time recollecting the past. Beloved comes into the story to help her remember. It is easy for Sethe to tell stories to Beloved about the past. Beloved is truly important. Is she really the ghost of Sethes baby, who she murdered? How can it be proven? Whether she is or is not, she still changes Sethe as if she were practicing her revenge. A combination of the realistic horrors of slavery to the mythical side of ghosts creates a balance of genres. This romantic, feminist, hysterical realism creates a memorable novel to read."

Yossarian is different from many of the men stationed there as he takes the war personally and gets annoyed that he has to be there, facing danger everyday. He continually tries to find ways to get out of the war and go home, but every plan he comes up with always has a catch, catch-22. This catch ruins all his plans and makes them seem illogical. Throughout the novel Yossarian has to fight against everyone to gain back his life and get what he wants.I enjoyed this novel because of the serious yet satirical tone that is used to convey the major theme. Heller used humor to make the book less controversial and to entertain the reader, while trying to make a statement. He also dealt with a very serious subject matter, the topic of war, which everyone has differing views on. He discusses the fighting and death that occurs in any war and is very graphic in his descriptions of what happens, but through being straightforward and blunt, Heller makes a stronger statement about war and its brutality. The descriptions affected me and my heart went out to all the soldiers involved in the war. Then, when Heller brought the humor back in I began to laugh out loud at the experiences he discussed. I truly enjoyed the way Heller wrote the novel and found that the mix of humor with the serious topic of war worked well to convey his message and made the novel truly original.The novel does not only discuss war and cannot just be considered an anti-war novel. The novel can relate to any aspect of human life and make sense in almost any situation, making it a universal novel. The issues that Catch-22 deals with are issues and emotions every person has confronted at one time or another, such as anger, loss, pain, determination and selfishness. All the characters have to overcome these emotions if they want to survive the war and make it in the world.I found Catch-22 to be an excellent novel about gaining your own freedom and becoming your own person and enjoyed the fact that it used such a controversial and universal topic as war to convey that message.A great read for anyone."
B000PCDFTQ,The ABC Murders,,A2T7JK9FLC8V0N,"S Riaz ""S Riaz""",0/0,5.0,1345680000,The ABC Murders,"This is one of the most interesting Poirot mysteries. It is 1935 and Hastings has returned from Argentina to visit - will he and Poirot get to hunt a murderer again? Poirot is concerned by an anonymous letter he has received, stating, ""look out for Andover, on the 21st of the month."" It is signed simply, ""ABC"". When an elderly woman, named Ascher, is found murdered in her little newsagent shop, Poirot and Hastings become involved in a case which is different to any they have faced before. It seems a homicidal maniac is striking victims at random, based only on the first letters of their name and the place that they live. An ABC railway guide is always placed on or near the vitim. As the bodies mount, the families and friends of the victims propose working with Poirot, to help solve the case.This novel shows why Agatha Christie is still the best crime writer of all time. The book may be set in the 1930's, but she has such an understanding of human nature and her plot and characters all stand the test of time. Her books never drag, are always immensely readable and Poirot - well, he is simply the best fictional detective ever created. Enjoy!"
B000881Y4K,"Desert wife,",,,,11/12,5.0,915753600,One of the best accounts I've read of western women's lives,"As an avid reader of first-person accounts of the lives of women in the early West, I would call this one of the finest I've seen. It's an absorbing tale of a woman's adjustment to the bleak and initially terrifying emptiness of the desert Southwest where her husband sets up an Indian trading post at the time of World War I. She comes to love the place and to appreciate the culture and manners of her Indian neighbors, which at first seem so alien to her. Hilda Faunce gives us a fascinating direct view of the interaction of Indians and whites, which is only the more interesting from our current vantage point 85 years later. I was struck by her simple, straightforward, but eloquent writing style as well as by her courage and receptiveness in facing a very challenging experience. I felt as if I'd entered her world, and was sorry to leave when the book was over."

That's the genre for this book. In February 1986 Joyce tendered his letter of resignation to Gene Jankowski. He begins his tale of the events leading up to that action by first describing the early years of the organization he left, CBS. &quot;CBS News consistently measures itself by its past&quot; he writes. He talks about the &quot;glory days&quot; of Edward R. Murrow and the &quot;handful of young men&quot; who created broadcast news from scratch, with no model to follow.It is hard to comprehend how corporate decisions are made. Dan Rather inherited a prestigious news organization as far as ratings were concerned. While his performance has kept the network at or near the cellar the entire time he's been in the anchor slot, he seems arrogantly secure in his position. Joyce points out that both inside CBS and outside there was concern when Walter Cronkite announced he was stepping down, that Rather did not have the qualities necessary for the anchor slot. It was assumed Roger Mudd would be next in line to replace Cronkite. Subsequent ratings all these decades later showed Joyce's observation at the time was correct. Evidently the decision-makers at CBS have an agenda other than public preference.There are other glimpses of the inner workings of CBS during the 1980s. For anyone still interested in CBS, perhaps better phrased, for anyone interested in corporate bureaucracy this book is full of examples of decisions that were not always the most logical."

Perhaps because I'm an avid fan of mysteries and suspense novels, my expectations were high that a few delicious twists might save the plot before it came to a close.

073666808X,Mrs. Dalloway,,AY6A8KPYCE6B0,Tate,18/20,5.0,1299542400,How to Read Mrs. Dalloway,"Mrs. Dalloway is not your conventional novel. It is uniquely and purposely so different from the novel that if you try to read it lazily in a by-the-beach summer mindset, you will likely A) not understand the ""plot"" (though admittedly the novel has very little conventional plot) B) the characters and C) the brilliance of it. Fortunately, all it takes is a splash of research before beginning and you should be well on your way to devouring one of literature's most delicious stories.The most important starting place is the characters. Feel free to cheat. Look at sparknotes or wikipedia and read the mini bios over each one. It's very helpful, for instance, in knowing that Septimus Smith is a shell-shocked WWI veteran. While it's no real secret in the story--characters refer to it, he thinks crazy things, etc.--some of his thoughts really aren't so crazy sounding since Mrs. Dalloway and other characters also think in odd metaphors and view the world in curious manners. The blending of crazy and noncrazy characters is also what makes the novel so interesting.Step 1: Pre-know characters. Septimus Smith, Mrs. Dalloway, Peter Walsh, and Sallly Seton being key. Note that Septimus and his wife are not actually friends or relatives of Mrs. Dalloway, they have never met, they do not know each other at all.Step 2: Expect point of view changes. The first time I read Mrs. Dalloway this threw me off the most. Throughout the novel there will be many instances when the point of view will be passed on to the perspective of some other character, often without warning, but not unrecognizably so. Woolf usually adds a single sentence or two to set minds apart so you know the switch is occurring, but it's still easy to get lost in the consciousnesses as every character thinks in lengthy sentences. Keep in mind that this is not a flaw in Woolf's writing, if you expect point of view switches to float about you will not be surprised by them. It is also very poetic how Woolf accomplishes this, as if all minds were connected and could be dived into in the way a falling leaf can travel in blowing wind.Step 3: Understand that plot is minimal. To say that ""nothing happens"" in this novel would be both correct and misleading. As far as actual events go, there are very very very few. Mrs. Dalloway buys flowers, A car passes by, a plane writes letters in the sky, a party is planned and held. These are some of the major plot elements that occur in a typical sense. The overwhelming majority of this novel occurs in the mind. Memories hold some events, but even then actual physical scenes are minimal. What you should expect while reading Mrs. Dalloway is to enter a realm of thoughts. It sounds very difficult if you've never encountered stream-of-consciousness writing, but it is surprisingly easy to get the hang of, especially since Virginia Woolf writes it better than anybody.Step 4: Keep an eye out for themes. This is the kind of novel that should be read with a highlighter in hand. There are just so many beautiful sentences that deserve to be marked for future reference. Also, highlighting can keep track of some of the great themes this novel possesses. Look at how frequently the word ""Moment"" is used in various contexts. Look at how often flowers and trees are references to and given life-like qualities. ""Failure"" is another key word along with so many more, but I don't want to narrow your thinking. Mrs. Dalloway is the kind of novel that speaks of everyone in a different way and what you take away from it will no doubt be very different than what I or literary critics have noted over time. Researching a few scholarly critiques might help, too, though.For me, at least, that's all I needed. The first time I read this book I thought it was pretty and well written, but I had no understanding of the plot or how the narrative flow was working. I don't even think I realized that the point of view switched several times. If you're having trouble, just put a tiny bit of effort into it and start over. You will be sooo happy you did because this is literature at its ground-breaking best.~Once You've Finished The Novel~And once you've finished and are so amazed and enlightened, you'll no doubt want to experience more Mrs. Dalloway brilliance. Fortunately, Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize winning novelThe Hoursuses biographical information about Virginia Woolf along with many themes and ideas from the novel and turns it into a modern masterpiece. It is a must-must-must-must-must read, but I would definitely wait until you read Mrs. Dalloway first.If you have any other questions while reading Mrs. Dalloway feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to help out as much as I can!"

Janos III,3/15,4.0,1078790400,Judging Other's Sins & Seeing None Elsewhere Needs Reform!,"The author, preacher, social activist, founder of the National Action Network, and now presidential candidate has written a provocative book on his experiences of the last century and vision for America for our new century.He takes on all power bases in America including the Political Parties. He calls the Democrats the Democratic Leisure Class because he believes they serve the elitists liberal leisure wealthy class of the powerful with media ownership and access to influence the people and maintain control over the processes of democracy.The book is simplistic in its approach to foreign relations dragging it all down to the sins of slavery, that is good argument, but we need more innovative policies for the future. I did find his insights on having lunches with Arafat and Castro enlightening. However, if he thinks he has influence with them then start having these icons of brutality start to mend their ways in their 70's. I will not hold my breath waiting for it.I found his political beliefs quite striking with roots in the conservative and liberal camps making him far more moderate than even he knows today. He backs Judaism beliefs by being against the death penalty and advocates far more understanding and assistance for those who committed crimes. He sees no difference between repentance and forgiveness and thus seeks prison improvement, and I support him on that cause. He feels this will progress society by helping those branded with mistakes of youth and poor judgments to reform with kindness and skills and expects victims to forgive as taught by religious leaders.Moreover, Al Sharpton as a preacher knows the scriptures teach gay sexual practices as a sin but he sees no reason to interfere with an individual's right to practice what he or she wants in life without discrimination letting fate, heaven, or hell decide the paths for everyone.Finally, the Presidential candidate thinks a woman's right to choose should be accepted but does not approved of abortion personally.He is more silent and confused on health care because like many of us it is a choice that will take huge resources from education in the future since America cannot pay for everything.As an advocate of justice, he reveals mix results but retains his strong emotions. The author addresses only his own views on Tawana Brawley, Amadou Diallo, and Abner Louima cases plus the racist's events of Howard Beach and Bensonhurst. They are in direct conflict with the court records. Therefore, he loses creditability since the records are far more fair and precise in their findings than in his adaptations of those events.I believe Al Sharpton has entered into a new phase in his life by writing this book. He knows he must be taken more seriously by the powers in the Democratic Party and public domain for the approval to be elected. No matter how he wants to cut the truth his way, he has to be elected in order to have a place at the table of real power. Power is one thing that cannot be faked, you either have it, or do not, and this book reveals he wants it.I think he will eventually be elected and his transformation from being branded himself as a bias bully to today's fair-minded opportunists will then have to be compromised if he wants to accomplish some of the goals he lays out in this book.It is a good book if you seek to learn more about a man who is learning more every day about him and us so he can build, contribute, and be productive in building a better America."

I bought it based on the rave reviews I kept hearing, yet a third of the way through I still couldn't understand what all the fuss is about. I don't profess to being an incredibly intellectual person but I do love to read challenging, thought provoking and just simply entertaining novels. This novel was none of the above. I'm hard pressed to believe that Oprah considered featuring this in her book club. Perhaps she liked the cover art, the only intriguing and interesting thing about this book.In all fairness, I didn't finish reading the novel. Actually, I COULDN'T finish reading the novel. It was an ordeal, a chore. I felt myself getting depressed over the thought of having to trudge through 500+ pages just to get to the last paragraph. The problem with Franzen's writing is he makes you jump through flaming circus hoop after flaming circus hoop before rewarding you with the point he's trying to get across. His writing is dry, every other word is enormous, difficult and academic (no doubt to show off his impressive vocabulary) and he makes many references to people, places and things that leave the average reader clueless. This novel comes off as a bit pretentious, self indulgent (like the screenplay the Chip character was trying to write) and highly alienating to the average reader.Enid and Alfred were the only two interesting characters. The other characters were dull, annoying and just plain uninteresting. I found myself not caring what happened to any of them. I didn't even want to know what happened to them. I was surprised with myself when I put the book down and said ""Enough is enough!"" I usually finish every book I start but I wasted too much of my personal time on this book, not to mention my hard earned cash as well. ""The Corrections "" is intended solely for the literati elite.If this is the future of the great American novel, then give me Jackie Collins anyday!"
0618077049,The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans,,A1E15WYG9C47X1,"""mobby_uk""",9/10,5.0,1062288000,Majestic Beasts,"Men's fear and fascination of monsters have been with us since the dawn of time, and while the imagination of our forefathers was the main source for describing these beasts under the sea, up the snowy mountains or deep in the jungle, our technological and scientific age helped us to unravel a lot of these mysteries,and sadly bringing a lot of nature's animals to the brink of extinction in the process.Yet, this fascination, and apprehension remain with us to this day.While Jaws was responsible for keeping a lot of people out of the water for a while, me included, the portrayal of the great white shark was too over sensualized to be scientifically accurate, something author Peter Benchely tried desperately to redress years later.The man eating Lions of Tsavo, were real yet a rarity in the history of man against 'beast, a historical incident that was all but forgotten, to be revived later with the film Ghost and Darkness.Yet there is another animal out there, and most specifically in the Sundarban region of India, bordering Bangladesh, who also feasts on people each year, and who very little is known about, a mystery as dense as the region it inhabits,(one of the last true wilderness in the world,) the majestic tiger.And to that end, Sy Montgomery has done a wondeful job in investigating this elusive animal, writing a unique book of its kind, that is part natural history, part detective story.The Sundarban tigers are unlike any tigers in India, or in the world. They regularily attack humans, even snatching people from boats in the middle of the river.They are both feared and revered by the locals as creatures of divine power/source(a phenomenon that in itself has allowed many wild animals to coexist in relative peace with humans)However, the plight of the tiger is one tragic story, (some subspecies extinct while others following suit in an alraming speed) and the impression I got from Montgomery's book is not one of fear, although there are some scary moments in the book,tracking the elusive tiger, but one of respect for this beautiful creature. An impression that convinced me these attacks were against people going inside the tiger's territory, invading its lair, as opposed to the well documented cases of man-eating leopards and wolfs that boldly invade human's territory.Saving the Tiger at all costs is another impression I got from this book, a need that becomes ever more pressing, realizing the relenteless onslaught from loss of territory or poaching the tiger faces every day.By all account buy this book, and I guarantee you too will be fascinated by the story of when that beautiful animal do what it is instinctively programmed to do to survive."

I enjoyed this book so much that I read it twice. It is interesting to see how she wove her life that held a rich heritage of Victorian culture, antiques, and an elegant childhood home with its surrounding areas into her detective stories. I now see elements of her grandmother in Miss Marple. Fascinating! Some of the fantastic happenings in her stories were sparks of her imagination mixed with memory. Her novels under the name of Mary Westmacott are wonderful, too."

It is a lively exploration of the quaint turns of phrase, social peculiarities, and other habits that identify the British upper-classes (charmingly referred to as U), as distinguished from the lower-classes (non-U).As the title suggests, what makes an aristocrat is a sense of Noblesse Oblige, or the obligation of the nobility to put his high position at the service of those beneath him, and at the service of the common good. That being said, there is always a je ne sais quoi about the fictional and non-fictional characters of the Aristocracy that make them sometimes irresistible and other times loathsome, but always fascinating, and often extremely funny.If you simply want to know for the sake of idle curiosity--or if you want to avoid the blunders (beginning with audible self-promotion and ending with obnoxious table manners) that might make the occasional aristocrat you run into at a dinner party either enjoy your conversation (think of Elizabeth Bennet) or avoid you like the plague, (think of Mr. Collins) you will enjoy this book.If you are a sociologist studying the nature of class-distinctions which the human race routinely creates (in spite of every attempt to prevent it) than you will REALLY enjoy this book.If, on the other hand, the very thought of social class gives you hives, avoid this book at all costs."
B0007DRGI4,To kill a mockingbird,,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",1/1,5.0,1197936000,A Moving Reading of a Wonderful Book by Roses Prichard,"Like many youngsters, I was assigned To Kill a Mockingbird to read as a 15 year old. Unlike most, however, the assignment was for speed reading class . . . rather than American Literature.Don't ever read this book for speed reading class.I always intended to get back to the book for a more leisurely reading that would allow me to take in the obvious brilliance of Harper Lee in more ways. I was pleased to find that my local library offered an unabridged reading by Roses Prichard (an actress with a Ph.D. in Communications from the University of Southern California) for Books on Tape.In the first 15 seconds, I knew I had made a winning choice. Roses Prichard turns Scout (Jean Louise) Finch into a girl you'll feel like you've known all your life. Take the time to find this wonderful recording: You'll discover more in this book than you've ever thought could be in a book describing the thoughts and experiences of a five- to eight-year-old narrator.Jem and Scout Finch are the only children of Atticus Finch, a highly principled lawyer in the small Southern town of Macomb, Alabama, whose wife died young of a heart attack. Unlike many novelists who cram their story into a few hours or days, Harper Lee showed the good sense to give us the family history and to let the children grow up over a few years before entering the heart of her tale. It's good story-telling and is great for character development.Jem is five years older than Scout but tolerates her company as long as she doesn't start acting like a girl. That's fine with Scout who prefers overalls to dresses any day. As Jem grows older, he finds himself taking on the role of protector as well.The children acquire a summer friend, Dill, and decide they want to meet the reclusive Arthur (Boo) Radley, a neighbor who always stays indoors. They have many adventures that will remind you of Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Injun Joe's cave.The book is written in pre-Civil-Rights-era Alabama when consciousness of the bad things done to African Americans wasn't very well developed among those who weren't African Americans. The only people in the story who seemed to appreciate the full horror of discrimination are those who are honestly trying to live the Christian life. But even many practicing Christians proved to be blind to their African American neighbors' needs and concerns.Harper Lee does a fine job of skewering all of those who are hypocrites on the subject of race. She even takes an appropriate shot at northerners who avoid the company of African Americans.In a way, this book was The Uncle Tom's Cabin of the Civil Rights Movement, developing the consciousness that helped to change some attitudes towards African Americans.The story also features lots of insights into Southern ""justice"" of the day -- inside the court, in the jury box, in jail, and in prison. To bring the evils of the attitudes to bear, Harper Lee tells us that it's wrong to kill a mockingbird . . . they only sing for us to enjoy and don't do any harm. By the end of the book, some of those in Macomb begin to feel that way about harmless human beings who do good, as well.You can learn more about Southern culture and attitudes in the early 1960s by reading this book than by studying a dozen nonfiction texts. Harper Lee got it right. One of the lightning rods for racial tension in those days was unwarranted sexual fear of African-American males. That theme is fully developed through having an African-American be accused of raping a white woman.But what I think makes this book timeless is its focus on what it means to be a good person . . . the story of Atticus Finch and his struggles with being both a good man and a good father.But years from now you won't forget Scout: She's one of the great heroines in American literature and an important prototype of what the next generation should have become in loving other people.Appreciate the untapped potential all around you!"

What a mean coincidence that it had to happen when banks were going through tough times. This book, perhaps Steinbeck's best, brings the personal melodrama of Of Mice and Men on the road with a family of 14 Oklahomans. Meet the Joads, who have lived on the same land for many generations. They have killed for the land and have died for it. The bank has forclosed on the home loan, and they have been pushed out. Now they gather all they can carry with them, sell all they can't, and hit the road in a rickety car and with only about a hundred dollars and wild hopes. Grandma and Grampa are the stern, traditional voice of the family, Ma and Pa lead the family in their oddysey west, Uncle John is a booze hound with strength and grit, Noah is a strange individualist, Al is the testosterone filled young man, Tom is an ex-con who just happens to be the pragmatist and clearest thinker, Ruthie and Winfield are the wild kids, and Connie and Rose are newlyweds. I know I am forgetting someone. The book is divided into two parts: the journey to California and their heartbreaking quest to make a living. It just happens that they are members of an outcast society despised by everyone. Throughout the book they are run out of settlements, antagonized and harassed, and mistreated. A member of the oddysey is Jim Casy, a former preacher. Casy turns himself in for beating a deputy to keep Tom from getting turned in and in prison meets a man who wants to end the victimization of migrant workers. He wants to form unions. While protesting against a peach orchard (that the Joads just happen to be at) he is killed by corrupt deputies. The book is shattering in so many ways: the way the Joads are treated, how the migrants at large are treated by the cops and by the rich malevolents, and how the general people allowed themselves to be blinded by bitterness and hate. There are several deeply affecting passages: one where a bunch of oranges are dumped in a vacant area behind a Hooverville (where 'Okies' lived), then kerosene was dumped on them so that the impoverished Okies couldn't eat them; the part in which the deputies send in a starving guy to start a fight in a government camp so they can break it up (because the government camp is treating Okies like humans), one man owning a million acres and not even farming it, just owning it so he can say he owns it. These concepts of gluttony and cruelty are more than the poor migrants can take. I absolutely loved the book and think every person should read it: it shows what happens when ordinary people are hated, and how devastating and frivilous that hate can be."
B000GROP62,Nineteen Eighty-four,,A2IUOJVG32WJOR,Geebus,2/2,5.0,992908800,Think again,"Not all doom and gloom from page 1, 1984 is still one of the most intense, dark and thought provoking books I have ever come across. What makes it compelling is the way in which it not only examines the human condition but also bludgeons it to a bloody pulp. So why have so many people enjoyed reading such a depressing story, ever since it's release in the late 1940's? I believe it to be the manner in which the novel blurs your ""in-built"" judgement of what is right and wrong, good and evil, in respect to civil liberties and the power of governing authorities. The way it inspires you to look behind the diplomacy and see the agenda. And the way it forces you to examine your own rationale for your assumptions and actions. The more I think about it, the more I like this novel and how it manages to look at the big picture and yet still remain personally affecting."

187806777X,Nervous Conditions: A Novel,,A3JP1G34LUQ36U,"AfroerotiK ""Scottie""",1/2,4.0,1237075200,Hungry for More,"Nervous Conditions is the intricate and symbolic narrative of an adolescent girl in colonized Zimbabwe who manages to establish herself as a feminist survivor amidst the oppressive forces that surround her. Poverty dictates the social clime of the era where education is the only escape. Metaphorical references abound in the novel that looks at oppression, race, class, sexuality, and gender and examines the often deadly ramifications of assimilation as an avenue for escapism. A country hungry for independence and a woman starving herself to suppress her pain is just one example of the dichotomous network of upheavals and conflicts woven into this powerful social commentary.The rebellious and head-strong Tambu spares no reader the pain of suffering along with her as she delves deep into her emotional well to describe her disdain for a sibling who has betrayed her, her family that revels in her misery, and as she searches for true freedom from psychological and mental bondage. It is the astonishing individuality and insightful deliberations of the narrator that establishes the tone as the reader is drawn into discussions of domestic violence, depression, and survival. To remain a strong, Black, connected woman in a society that has eaten the very being of those around her is Tambu's greatest obstacle. While others have succumbed to the lore of the oppressors humiliation and degradation, Tambu survives, calling upon a sense of history and identity not of her time. It is surely the knowledge of the ancestors that has been imparted to her that has been held deep within her very soul that gives her more maturity, knowledge and stamina than those around her who have come to identify themselves through the bluest eye of the oppressor.Nervous Conditions shows that imperialism is not just an economic form of bondage, but also a sociological one in which its captors suffer exponentially from the rape of cultural and spiritual norms. Dangarembga's novel is a brilliantly painted picture of the human spirit excelling in the face of resistance."

B000E65DFC,The Robe,,A1ARA52HB238HT,"Matthew M. Yau ""Voracious reader""",32/41,5.0,1077321600,Jesus still surprises us,"The Robe probably has transcended its original scope of reconstructing the life of Jesus and his stamping on the mind of many about the coming of his new kingdom. Douglas has not only added new touch and sentiment to the story of Jesus, but also invigorated the historical period a skein of unforgettable characters whose lives were touched and thus inevitably changed their lives by Jesus' teaching.It might be difficult to conceive that Marcellus Gallio, son of a prestigious Senator and a Tribune; Diana, the granddaughter of the Emperor Tiberias; and Demetrius, the Greek slave from Corinth, to believe Jesus' miracles and his resurrection. Lloyd Douglas has written truly a religious classic, one whose appeal is not limited to a particular time or a particular place, through the delineation of the characters' own struggle to cross that arbitrary line beyond which the credibility should go. .Marcellus was a Roman soldier who by a fortuity executed Jesus' crucifixion and subsequently won Jesus' robe as a gambling prize. The robe symbolized his crime, the crime of recklessly crucifying an innocent man who exhausted him life in advocating love, kindness, and goodwill. The memory of the crucifixion, had been an interminable torture that plunged Marcellus into a deep melancholy. Demetrius could never tell when his master was hit by a capricious seizure that sent sweat streaming his face.The robe miraculously healed the inconsolable Marcellus as he touched it. From there Marcellus set off on a quest to seek the truth about the robe and the Nazarene who claimed to own his kingdom somewhere not in the world. Testimony about Jesus' miraculous power, which to a large extent agrees with my nostalgic memories from the bible, had been cumulative and that it had been coming at Marcellus from all directions. Jesus' teachings and the marks he left on those whose lives changed had penetrated Marcellus' skeptical mind and descended in him a sense of duty and mission. He had killed this man who had spent his life doing kind things for needy people, and the only way he could square up for it was to spend his life like Jesus did.It dawned on Marcellus that a thorough understanding of Jesus and his teachings required faith and surrender rather than a recondite knowledge. This point bespeaks the minds of modern-day Christians who involuntarily proceed to push the intrusive concept away no matter how convincing the evidences of supernatural power in the miracles are. His slave Demetrius, who had been inebriated by Jesus long before his master, had such an indomitable faith in the truth of Jesus' resurrection though his master had vaunted his frustration and indignation over him.Quest for the robe also accents the beauty of a master-slave relationship. Demetrius' life had become so inextricably related to the life of Marcellus that his freedom, if it was offered him, indeed by the Senator as he was to take Marcellus to Athens, might cost him more in companionship than it was worth in liberty of action. When offered his freedom, Demetrius magnanimously denied it at the peril of his master's recovery. The witty slave also directed to have Marcellus disguised as a fabric connoisseur in order to penetrate inconspicuously into Galilee to capture wind of the savior. It was not surprising to see that the whole quest for the robe made the master-slave relationship difficult to sustain.Ancient Rome against which the book sets accents the significance and validity of men's faith. The quest for the mysterious truth allowed Marcellus to take on a different perspective with the world, especially Rome with which he felt so out of place. He began to despise its injustice, to pity its tragic unhappiness, and to shun the avarice of the influential ones. Marcellus felt his own obligation to associate with a movement that the Government had outlawed, had labeled seditionists, and unflinchingly preached the word to everyone. He embarked on the defense of a good cause Jesus started and had yet to finish.2004 (10)"

It impressed me both with the recipes and the ideas for dinner table activities and family get-togethers. I found it truly an inspiration and it has changed the way my family eats dinner and communicates. In the book &quot;Table Talk&quot; the &quot;Once A Month Cooking&quot; book was referred to. For a year I've looked for it in various bookstores and it wasn't until I became a customer of Amazon.com that I found it. A month ago I ordered this book. This past weekend I cooked for 6 hours and now have 17 meals in my freezer. It is truly a wonderful feeling to be organized an prepared for evening meals. Weekday evenings have become the hardest part of the day in our household due to dual working parents, and busy schedules for all. This method is so logical, efficient, time saving and stressfree - just buying the groceries was easier, even though I bought twice what I normally would. With a pre- written list and virtually no decisions to make at the grocery store itself, I was out of there in half the time! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to put nutritious delicious meals on the table night after night with far less stress. This book is especially helpful for me because it allows me to prepare meals at a time of my choosing, when *I* have the energy to spend doing it, not when I have to pull something together after a tiring and busy day. Thank you thank you to both Mimi Wilson &amp; Mary Beth Lagerborg for this book. By writing this book, and sharing this logical efficient method, you've provided a service that I can now pass on to my children, my husband and others."

It's all deceptively simple but the metallic scaffolding of the novel resonates with skilled observation and tactful narration.Most dialogue is short and to the point whereas most novels are full of verbose yet languid conversations which say very little. Murakami is the opposite of this- a little said says it all. It's an entire atmosphere he manages to piece together with simplicity, an whole chapter can be summarized by the five-word ending which emphasizes the urbane nature of daily life: ""We actually did see a double feature."" ""The rain kept falling until midnight. ""Time was surely passing.""Once you're enveloped in the glow of the artistic minimalism of the prose, the gears shift a bit. There are two congruent chapters (Chapter 17 and 18) full of lengthy dialogue that runs counterintuitive to the rest of the novel. It's so out of place in the novel that it annoying sticks in your mind while you're trying to enjoy some of the more innocuous things in the novel like a shopping list, a farting cat or the consumption of beer. I found it terribly distracting.Nearing the end, time began to be counted off by the days and by bottles of brandy. The sheep chase was obviously coming to a close but it was also tapering off into boredom as the adventure was pretty much as its end. The conclusion had be shrugging my shoulders, admitting to myself that I didn't understand it but I'm sure I just missed something. The fantasy elements included in the unraveling plot also had be shrugging and hoping that the novel could be based more so on the intricate details of daily life, an observational novel of the mundane. This novel almost breaches this sub-genre but goes off on its own tangent.Wild Sheep Chase had a good thing going before Chapters 17 and 18 and it also had a great run between 19 and 32. I give it great marks for making me smile, laugh and for leaving me in awe at the clever simplicity."

It wasn't that it was so much racier than, say, Saturday Night Live or some of the current GOP rhetoric: I just got exasperated with the eternally adolescent whining of the main characters! Been there, heard that, thank you."
B0006APNP6,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,,A3OJFPKMCXKOM0,K.A.Goldberg,1/1,5.0,1135296000,Inspiring Narrative of Life on the River,"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."

0679463356,Shalimar the Clown: A Novel,,A2O9L2LA6Z5LXJ,Konrad Baumeister,4/5,5.0,1154822400,Gripping story,"Shalimar the clown is basically a story of two villages in disputed Indian Kashmir, one Hindu and one Muslim, and the lives of their people as first pastoral happiness, then bitter civil war, then terrorism and eye-for-an-eye retribution and bitter revenge devastate life as it was known. In the center is a young couple, Boonyi and Shalimar, who fall in love; and the breaking of their bond and life together is mirrored by the complete breakdown of all that is decent and good around them.The book starts slow, and Rushdie's writing style, while perhaps well chosen for the locations and people he is here portraying - definitely otherworldly and a deft mixing of narrative and legend - unfortunately does not help it take off. Characters are introduced which may well be colorful but which may be hard to relate to; there is a lot on village history, kings and princes and times and events of long ago which do not seem to add significantly to the progression of the story.And then things pick up. One selfish act takes place - and everything changes. We are reintroduced to the world: names are discarded, changed, picked anew, fresh with meaning; identities, titles and roles are altered; all that was stable is now unstable, fact and legend are now intertwined, the known world is violated, dishonored, destroyed, set ablaze and a newer and much much uglier one takes its place. Nobody is who they were, all names are lies, honor and personal values are reduced to murder, not only for Shalimar, but for old Misri, for the General, ultimately even for Kashmira. ""No more mister nice guy,"" says the commander of Abu Sayyaf late in the book, and he means it. The gloves are off, no punches are pulled; the story relentlessly becomes more serious and violent. It's not pretty.The characters are all richly imagined, expertly drawn, and each evolves, impacted by the world around them - and therefore typically for the worse. Especially the degeneration of Shalimar from a seemingly innocent and dumb but loveable man-boy to a driven homocidal maniac is superbly executed; no doubt Rushdie has had quite some time to work on putting such a character on the page. Rushdie can write with humor, sarcasm, sensitivity and sometimes very movingly; his occasional lapses into technique trickery can therefore leave one a little annoyed. But Rushdie is a writer of exceptional talent, just sometimes a little unevenly applied.It is a tragic, tragic tale - all the more important that people should also realize that it may as well be the truth."

B000J521DU,"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.",,ABSFQWT5M0VQS,Ethel Mirviss,4/7,5.0,1081987200,5 STARS 100%!!!!!,"Eragon is by far perhaps one of the best and most riveting and interesting books i have ever read. My friend urged me to read it, and finally i took her advice and i am thrilled that i did.The characters and events are linked together in such a way that lulls the reader into the story, with such accurate descriptionws you feel as if you are actually in the story. The second i picked up this book, i was hooked and spent the entire day doing nothing, but sitting on the couch reading until i finished it.Some people have been complaining about Eragon being too closely related to lord of the rings, but i think these people are sorely mistaken. Yes, Eragon does have elves being tall and majestic and wise/powerful, and dwarfs being short and stout adn digging holes just like Lord Of the Rings, btu do you really think tolkein made up all of those things himself? No, im sure that Tolkein got influences for his book from other books written before him, so why are people assuming that eragon just copies from lord of the rings.Here's a few examples of remarks made that i want to set straight1. Eragon has nothing to do with Aragon, so forget that. If you replace the ""E"" in Eragon with a ""D"" you will spell Dragon. Very smart and creative.2. Just because Arya and Arwen are elves and have dark colored hair does not make Arya a copy-cat of Arwen. It's like writing a book where the heroine's a blong girl who's smart, and having people say that you must be copying from Legally Blond. One word- REDICULOUS!!!!!!3. za-rac and Urgals have nothing to do with the uruk-hai and black riders, they're very original and i don't see why people are comparing them.4. I also don't understand why people are saying that Paolini copied from Mccaphrey. The animal connection theme has been done in hundreds/thousands of books since the beginning of time, and just because he chose a dragon to connect with the person doesn't mean he's copying. Also he's not copying when he says that dragons were identified by color. OMG how dare they be identified by color like everything else in life, red phone or blue phone, black cat or white cat, e.t.c. ( duh people).5. My last comment is that just because the names of places are similar doesn't mean he's copying, he simply used names that were similar. There are so many names in the world that similarities dohappen, i don't see how we can penalize him for this.Chris Paolini did an amzing thing when he wrote this book, by introducing the world to a new series of fantasy. I am sorry that other people seem to be afraid of his potential as a writer and must degrade him by saying that he copied his whole book from other well-known works of writing. Why is it that when someone with amazing potential comes forth, people are always so determined to put them down? I don't know but i do know that this is one of the best books that i have ever read, and i would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy and adventure. FANTASTIC JOB CHRIS PAOLINI.....I look forward to your next book."
B00086037Q,A hero of our time,,A2Y91AI8L4CBIN,Radcliffe Camera,10/11,4.0,966643200,Move Over Onegin: Enter Pechorin,"A Hero of Our Time introduces a most memorable character, Pechorin, who, had the novella been named after him, would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Eugen Onegin in fame. He derives from the same tradition as Onegin, that of the 'superfluous' man, though he moves beyond his predecessor (and prefigures others) in the degree to which he reeks havoc on a personal level. The novella consists of stories only nominally connected, and it is fair to say that the second half is better than the first. The centrepiece is the diary of Pechorin which contains a full narrative of his 'adventures' at a small holiday town. It just has to be read to be believed: it is 'lady-killing' and 'white-anting' at its clinically destructive best. Readers of Eugen Onegin will notice similarities, though the prose form allows much deeper characterisation, for which one is certainly not sorry. Lovers of later 19th-century Russian literature will appreciate this book in its prefiguring of characters and of settings in, among others, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky, and Chekhov. Lermontov died young and in a very Romantic fashion (a duel); one can only be sorry that he did not live to write more."

It is, quite simply, a classic American novel, and I feel that the previous two reviews (five stars, naturally) sum up the book's contents, its spiritual impulse, and finally, its dramatic impact on American letters better than I could here.What I would like to add, then, is that THIS SPECIFIC EDITION (the Penguin Classics Deluxe) is, by far and away, the best out there. In my mind, it is a collector's item, a kind of retro masterwork, and featuring the outstanding if not enigmatic illustrations by the artist known simply as Jason. To be sure: the drawing of Jack Kerouac and Gary Snyder (Japhy Ryder) sitting by the fire high in the mountains, immersed in the moment, is simply a gem.Finally, if you find this book to your liking, I think you should march right out (metaphorically speaking, I guess, since we are all on-line) and purchase John Suiter's stunning Poets on the Peaks, which is a large, well-designed photo and bio work about Snyder, Kerouac, Philip Whalen and their time spent as fire look outs on Desolation Peak - trust me, the photos in this coffee table book are utterly fascinating."

It was getting boring, until I picked up The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. This book is about Arthur Dent, who has a friend, Ford Prefect, from a foreign planet writing a book, when he says that the world is going to explode. This is the adventure through space to stay alive.My favorite part of the book is in the beginning when Arthur finds out that his house has to be demolished.'""But the plans were on display...""""On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.""""That's the display department""""With a flashlight.""""Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.""So had the stairs.""` This is one of my favorite parts because it just really sticks out in my mind and stays there. Another one of my favorite parts is when the Guide is speaking.'Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm the Galaxy lies a small unrewarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think the idea of digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has-or rather had-a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerted with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.' I find this funny because it sounds a lot like me and my friends, because we are amused easily.This book isn't like any other sci-fi book. I like it a lot because it is very funny and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone for its humor and adventure. It reminds me of Star Wars, except that it's not about jedi's, the force, and Yoda. I would say always have a towel on hand, and don't panic."

She 'see's it...but she doesn't *know* it. She writes from the point of view of Anne, who is the young Christian girl in question, and no where is there a reference to any running dialogue between this girl and God himself. She doesn't talk to God, only about God...there is a lot of talk 'about God', but no personal interchange between God and her. And that just isn't the way it is. I don't know any real christian who doesn't have a simple running conversation with God. 'Good morning God, thank you for today""...'Did you hear what that person said Lord? Forgive him..."" or any acknowledgement of a simple awareness of his presence...which is part and parcel of the christian experience....if you really know God.And because the book is supposedly about faith and how it is tried and shattered in tragedy I should think the book should at least start from a faith that is a real faith.The reality is that these people really did have a very simple faith, and a simple faith includes dialogue with God. And this town really did exist, and they were extraordinary people...Then there is the way she took a real characters that really existed and totally maligns his personal history. She justifies this by saying she changed his name and made her own rector up. She takes a huge twist of character and causes Michael Mompellian to turn out to be a monster, not a saintly Christian that he was, and in the end poor Anne is shattered of faith, used and abused by him and finds refuge among the gentle 'peaceful muslims' sheltered in a harem, but with 'no faith at all'. I found this shocking and contrived.ok...I know this is a major spoiler, but the ending was too outrageous and unrealistic, ESPECIALLY when in her own words Brooks points out that she modeled Mompellian after a real rector (a rector Mompesson) of a real town that really had the plague, and she owns herself that he was truly saintly by all accounts, yet says she ""envisioned a man powerful conviction and charisma. Such personalities are *sometimes governed by unwholesome motivations, such as belief they are God infallible instruments. They can be dangerous, even deadly"" end quote.So because she couldn't understand the real life historical rector who was a truly saintly man who really lived and suffered and was by all accounts good....she made up a monster to fit her agenda to smear Christianity. She judges these people while pretending to not, by making they weak and sniveling, dishonorable in every way. ...and blaming it on the Christian background....but I wonder if we placed a lot of secularists in such a town how they would endure.It will be a frightening and interesting thing to see if such trials are visted apon our modern secular America, what would happen.That is all this book was: a smear job.Whether it was intentional...I will not judge...but I will point out that Ms. Brooks knows less about the interior life of a real Christian then the poet of her book knew of the sea."

These four plays of Ibsen's so-called &quot;realistic period&quot; revolve around social issues of his day which plague us 100 years later. Do we ever learn from such literary wake-up calls? Although the dramatic tensions here, which could have easily have been 20th Century tensions, rumble through these plays, the translations here are wordy and dated, thus making the plays sound overly melodramatic and at times downright silly. Still, everyone should read -- and discuss -- Ibsen's plays for their uneasy questions regarding universal social problems: money, privacy, freedom to act, government corruption, unchecked journalism, and the moral and physical diseases which only seem to wear a new face each year."

It's true, just like there are languages that speak to the adult hearts, our children have different needs that show them that we truly love them. Each has a unique language that speaks love to them.This is why often times we may bend over backwards as a parent and our children still look at us, telling us that they desperately need to feel our love. What is happening is that we aren't speaking the same languages that they need. There are 5 love languages that speak to our children and sometimes there is a combination that works well for our kids. Some love Words of Affirmation, being told what a great job they are doing, how much we love and care for them, acknowledgement that we see what they are doing and praising them. While for yet other children, Acts of Service, speaks to their hearts, such as doing kind deeds for them, taking them to lunch, or a ball game, just spending time with them, and yet another is Physical Touch. These are the children who thrive on hugs and kisses and touch instead of words or actions by us.Authors Gary Chapman and Ross Campbell have collaborated to help parents speak the language of love our children so desperately need to hear in their book, The 5 Love Languages of Children. In this book not only do they break down each of these in detail, but it also includes a game to help both parents and children understand what works well for them. This way we can speak love to our children without being frustrated on both ends. It can also help us discipline our children more effectively when it needs to be addressed. This is a must read for anyone who deals with children, whether it be parents, grandparents and even child care givers or teachers!I received this book compliments of Propeller and Northfield Publishing for my honest review and learning so much about the love languages when it comes to adults, this seemed a natural for me to read as a parent. So many times with multiple children we try not to appear to favor one child over the other but often times find our actions frustrating when they don't respond as we would hope. This book really helps to identify what works for each child. I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars and seeing it benefiting even teachers who may be frustrated in reaching children who are struggling with learning. This book speak volumes to the hearts of our children."

The main argument is that the main people involved in these movements were Jews, who in an effort to prevent anti-Semitism, did everything possible to prevent strong group cohesion amongst culturally-homogenous Gentiles in the West. One of the best parts of the book is where MacDonald reviews ""The Authoritarian Personality,"" a widely-used psychology textbook written in the 1950s, which presents unhappy families as the healthy ones and content, closely-knit families as the dysfunctional ones. The idea behind this was to prevent anti-Semitism, as studies had shown that the members of closely-knit families are more likely to have strong group allegiances, and therefore, are more likely to be potential anti-Semites. MacDonald, a psychology professor, has a very deep academic writing style, which takes a bit of getting used to if you're not used to reading that style, but the content is well worth it. All in all, this is a very good book which goes a long way in explaining why the ideas that we're supposed to hold today are so drastically different from the ideas that our ancestors have held for hundreds of years."

I was hooked on his writings since the first time I read his book, which is this one. When I first finished reading this book some years ago, it changed my view in English literature altogether. What struck me was the stark honesty and reality in his writings. Never had I come across a writer who was as honest as Carver. He tells his stories the way life really is, without trying to twist, sensationalise or glamourise it. He tells stories about people like us. In fact, his stories are about us and the people around us.Don't be fooled by the length of his short stories, his shortest pieces like 'Neighbors' and 'Fat' are among his best (though I can't really point out any that is not his best anyway) because it tells so much in so little words.Another startling thing about Carver's stories is that it can relate to people everywhere in the world though he writes about Americans."

Applegate for seven years I highly recommend this book for those seeking to learn the history behind the WW2 CQC systems. This volume contains some manuels that I spent 20 fruitless years searching for.Don't be put off by the brevity of the courses being taught to commandos/O.S.S. agents. As the war progressed the instructors learned through bitter experience how few techniques were actually required to survive a life or death struggle. It is, however, difficult to really learn these methods from this volume (and other ww2 manuels)since they were intended as handouts to military student during training programs. But its a good start for those seeking pratical, bare bones, hard won knowledge."
B000KDPDPO,A Distant Mirror the Calamitous 14th Century,,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,Robert J. Crawford,7/8,5.0,1196035200,absolutely first-rate reconstruction of our medieval soul,"This is a wonderfully readable and engrossing book on the period that marked us more deeply - as the source of so many of our touchstone images and ideas - than just about any other. We, or at least I, imagine dungeons, cold, early death, blind faith, and the knightly order of repression and the search for glory. Tuchman questions these stereotypes and myths by holding them to intelligent scrutiny.Tuchman chose 14C, when the feudal order was at last breaking down, after nearly 500 years of relative stability as a politico-economic system, if tumultuous in terms of conquest and war. I have wanted for years to find an account of this second dark ages, when the fabulous expansion of the Gothic era ended in plague, famine, war, and the beginnings of popular revolt. Tuchman chooses an aristocrat, Coucy, as the vehicle for this story, and the choice is a perfect fit. She also follows the great writers of the time, including Chaucer and Petrarch, in fascinating detail.Coucy was the embodiment of the late Chivalric ideal: rich, prudent, decidedly less cruel than his forebears, militarily brilliant and a fine diplomat. Rather than rush into military engagement with relish and rashness as his contemporaries tended to do for glory, he actually analyzed the situation and chose his moment. He leads an exemplary life of service, though dies in shame as a prisoner in the hands of the Turks and without an heir. It is an incredible life, though we get to know little of his character and personal thoughts due to gaps in the documentary record.The age that Tuchman portrays is one in which everything that could have gone wrong, did. The plague kills up to 50% of the European population in several waves, which loosed the peasants from the land as labor costs rose with higher demand. A terrible war (of ""100 years"") began in France, devastating large portions of it by very unknightly pillage and simple havoc. The Catholic church suffers its first schism, which divides societies and plays out - destroying its image of unity - in the first great political-military disasters that get far far worse in the Reformation. Finally, the Turks are approaching and take Constantinople, after a series of victories that frightened the West with a new style of warfare. No wonder people felt the apocalypse was approaching.Most interestingly, the feudal system is under such stress that it is on the verge of collapse. Not only are knights proving incapable of facing up to growing popular rebellions with several shocking military defeats (e.g. William Tell in Switzerland), but their technology of warfare was in decline with the use of longbows (by British yeoman) and far more maneuverable lighter arms and professional standing armies (the Turks). With the end of their monopoly of force, the entire political system of landed aristocracy with limited loyalty to a central kingly authority was clearly on the way out - mercenaries and even nationalist armies are on the horizon. War is no longer an affair restrained by rule and knightly custom, where the captured expect to be held for ransom comfortably and perhaps for years, but is evolving into far more brutal confrontations with mass executions.Tuchman explains these developments with lightning clarity, in dense paragraph after paragraph. The reader gains wonderful insight into the forces that shaped the period. For example, I never had understood the chain of reasoning that went behind certain theological disputes, such as the ""transubstantiation"" of the body of christ in the wine and wafer of mass. If it wasn't true godhead, she explains, then the authority of the church (leading directly to the pope) would be undermined. Thus, it was defended with extreme violence. What I so love about popular historians is that, in contrast to many academics, they understand that this needs a brief explanation.Tuchman is brilliant at showing the period as a nexus, a watershed in which one order is giving way to another. She never assumes, however, inevitability and always brings a depth of understanding that never appears superficial, at least to me. That makes this a masterpiece on a crucial period, in my view. Her descriptions are poetic in their vividness. Interestingly, this is about the same period covered by Huizinga in Autumn of the Middle Ages, but brought to palpable life with the story of Coucy.Highest recommendation."
B000I1NDOG,Sylvester,,ABMNHEGVQZ6RS,"Heather Pearson ""Heather""",1/1,4.0,1315094400,Wonderfully Entertaining,"Sylvester, Duke of Salford, has decided that at the age of 28, it is time for him to marry. During the past season he survey the eligible ladies of quality and has presented to his mother a list of the five most suitable. While not surprised, she dismisses them all from consideration and suggests for consideration the daughter of her long deceased best friend.Phoebe Marlow has been raised since an early age by her stepmother. While a very efficient and strict mother, she is not nurturing nor loving. Her main goal is to get Phoebe married off as quickly as possible so that she can concentrate on the most suitable matches for her own daughters.Things take an interesting twist when Sylvester asks his godmother, who is also Phoebe's grandmother, about Phoebe. This sets in motion a chain of events involving a possible elopement, a broken leg, being socially ostracized, and finally an abduction.Once Phoebe escaped from the stifling confines of her stepmother, she blossomed. She no longer had to worry that she would be chastised for each and every word she said or action she committed. I found the new Phoebe a very likable character. Most Regency era women are written as too wimpy for me. This one has spunk and speaks her mind. On the other hand, Sylvester appears to be the haughty Duke that all expect him to be. Somehow, throughout their misadventures, they each manage to pull out the best and the worst in each other. This made for very amusing reading never knowing what to expect next.The style of writing in this book put me very much in mind of Jane Austen's style. Rich in detail and discussion of friends and family. All were most proper in manners and for their concern of their position in society. This is the second book that I have read by Georgette Heyer and leaves me wanting to read more."

Celine, and his Journey. The subject, here...Buk and Fante, they were great writers. But Celine got it. He captured it. And put it there, on the page, like some angry magician; what they were all after. As close to, something, as it can get. Some little piece - valuable, but dangerous; that no one since Dostoevsky had fiddled with. A story about a war. About love, rejection. The crummy soul of man. And the things, out there, that no one else wanted to talk about. The loneliness. The quietness of the night. The stuff that Shakespeare molded over, into a beautiful story. Like massaging a turd. No, Bill! Something's not right. Life is... ya know. Life is that goblin that was hiding underneath your bed the whole time, as a kid. And here Celine takes the flashlight to it. Sure, it's horrifying; but it's still there. Just the same. Might as well invite it up for coffee, or tea. Become acquainted. Before it jumps upon you....Other days, I'll pick it up. Read a couple of lines, here or there. Sometimes giggling. Sometimes stunned. Celine's writing is a style unlike most. Each paragraph sits there, on the page, reading like the dying gasps of a heart attack victim. The book is somewhat auto-biographical. Written through the cynical imagination of his character, Bardamu. A medical doctor, of sort. Celine doesn't use chapter numbers. And the crawl through the night undergoes a number of stark scenery shifts. Starting in that cafe terrace, speaking with his friend. All the way through the Congo, the Ford factories in Detroit, before landing back in France. In that miserably described Rancy.I would never call it a challenging read. But one that is challenging, for some. In another way. Ya really got be able to cut the fluff, to give it a fulfilling attempt. You gotta give thought, that we may just be walking and crapping things. Which is hard, for some.But, despite popular opinion pronouncing his evilness, Celine turned out to be a pretty funny guy. Which ok's him in my book. World War II was his joke, back at the world. ""Fine world, you want me to become something, after all of my fussing. Squirming. And pointing out of your absurdity? Fine. How is this? I will become an anti-Semitic, Nazi enthusiast. How's that?""A great writer. But a better book.Caught up in some of the darker moments of Mankind. One of the deadliest times, for their games. During a time when, no one was capable of judging another. Until it passed over them. And a winner declared.At the end of the night, survival only waits.Now go read it."

Dr. Hammer addresses exegetical and homiletic issues raised by the text. He comments on words, phrases, themes and structure, and adds pointers on generally accepted practice. A concise and informative introduction, commentary on Pirkei Avot, and a glossary are a bonus. This is a ""must have"" for the student of classical traditional Judaism and a great aid to the worshiper in the contemporary synagogue.The typeface of the prayerbook is small, with the commentary somewhat larger; the volume is large but managable.

In my English class we had to actually study Russian history and then relate it to the text (i.e. Snowball represents Trotsky). It was very helpfull.

I lived in the region for 8 years and find this book inaccurate in many ways. Perhaps Ms. Kingsolver shares the attitude that Farley Mowat expressed when he said that he &quot;never lets facts get in the way of the truth&quot;. Kingsolver's relativist &quot;truth&quot; is politically leftist and anti-religious, and she is apparently, like Mowat, not prepared to let facts get in her way.Just to name a few points:-The rebels that are portrayed kindly in this story, presumably because they were anti-western and anti-capitalist, were in truth bloodthirsty terrorists of the worst kind. They killed the father of a friend of mine, a doctor in Stanleyville (Kisangani) for no reason, in cold blood. They murdered thousands of their own countrymen as well.-The migrations of the army ants are not at like they are described in this book.-To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, &quot;I knew missionaries in Congo. Missionaries in Congo were friends of mine. Ms. Kingsolver, your characters are NOT missionaries in Congo.&quot; The main anti-hero in this story may or may not be plausible as a fictional character, but I am certain that no real character even remotely like him ever made it to Congo. What is the sense of talking about &quot;learning&quot; anything true about Africa from a fantasy?"

While the book is very descriptive of the poor conditions in many inner-city schools, Mr. Kozol's thesis--that more government money should be put into education--is not borne by the facts. He presents arguments that are unthoughtful, unacademic, and unsupported. He has a very hysterical knee-jerk response to anyone who is supportive of a free-market approach to education.For those who are fans of Kozol and believe that my review may be too extreme, I refer you to the book &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot;, also by Mr. Kozol. The book is little more than an apologia for Fidel Castro's dictatorship, a society with a conception of human rights that would not pass muster in a tribe of Barbary Apes (to borrow P.J.

I took it as a sophomore with little background in the subject. I found it to be very helpful, especially when the textbook didn't explain things in a way I understood it; it was great to get another vantage point. This book breaks down photosynthesis and cell respiration, two of the hardest parts of ap bio (oh, you may think you know, but you have no idea til you take this class), so that they are easily understood. Occasionally information was left out that my teacher put on one of our tests, so I reccomend using this book in conjunction with your textbook/own notes. The short reviews at the end of each section were great to do the night before a test because they don't take too long but they get the point across, explaining the reason for each answer thoroughly, whereas some books have long section quizzes that, by the time you finish, you don't have time to go over all the questions. The multiple choice practice ap test was harder than the actual ap exam (2007), but still great. I got a 5 (:D) and this book helped me get there, i reccomend it.Also reccomended: REA's ap biology with 6 full-length practice exams (was awesome to do in the weeks approaching the exam)"

I got the Anne of Green Gables books when I was in the second or third grade, and thought they were too deep for me and did not read them- but now being in sixth grade i read the Emily books- and loved them!! It is so hard to find books at age elven/twelve because i have read all that appeal to me (in my age section), and the young adult books are trash and junk- romance, dating, and other things i won't mention- compared to this. The words were beautiful!!! I loved how the main character Emily could think using her soul and not her mind- her endurence through her father's death was mysticillay (is that a word?!) mature.. and really added to my opinion and interpretation of her personality. I have to say that out of all three this-Emily Climbs- was the best- 'Emily of New Moon' was good, but did not include alot of her written literature- 'Emily's Quest' was OK but i was astounded at how much she had changed from a free-minded, easy-going, down-to-earth, deep thinker... into a stuck-up, proud, and conceited girl!!! She did not believe in herself, and lost hope and faith in all that she loved. I know that in the other two books she would not have let her friendships waste away and fade... and finally 'Emily Climbs' had a special charm and a special touch that the other ones did not have- a magic, sort of... you will have to find out for yourself... but anyhow, i wish L.M. Montgomery would write a fourth Emily book.... I adored the three and suggest them to anybody who has a good vocabulary (i found myself asking my mom and dad for definitions of words often)...

Yes, the author was a man of the 20th century, but he certainly improved my understanding of warfare before the machine gun. If there is one criticism of his book, I would have to say that it is in Liddell Hart's assumption that his reader already has a good grasp of military history. The &quot;you know this already, so I'll skip over to the conclusion&quot; attitude is very peculiar to the British, and I would recommend that one read some basic military history first before tackling what is definately a must read.The previous reader from Redlands, CA, is quite correct in viewing Liddell Hart with a critical eye. I'm no military history buff, but I do understand that LH was a bit of a controversial figure who spent much of his life maneuvering to gain his &quot;proper&quot; place in the history of strategic thought.

Allison (dallison@biochem.med.ufl.edu),32/37,5.0,927158400,The finest satirical novel written.,"Swift's classic satire of English and European governments, societies, and cultures should be required reading of every college student. (Except for those who appear to be in law school as is the earlier reviewer who referred to Swift as being an &quot;18th century Unabomber.&quot; Swift may have been conservative in his beliefs and not cared much for individuals such as Robert Boyle, who is satirized in the book, but he was not violent. Perhaps our &quot;law student/reviewer&quot; is offended by Swift's biting satire of lawyers and politicians in part four.) The version I read was an annotated edition by Isaac Asimov and contained many passages that had been deleted by previous publishers. Asimov's comments enable the reader to more fully appreciate Swift's satire. In part one of the novel, a ship's surgeon, Lemuel Gulliver, is shipwreaked and finds himself on the island of Lilliput, the inhabitants all being only six inches high. This section is great satire of English politics and wars. Royal ponp, feuds amongst the populace, and wars are made to look rediculous. In the second part, Gulliver finds himself in Brobdingnag in which he is only six &quot;inches&quot; tall (relatively speaking). This part forms another satire of European governments. In part three, Gulliver visits the flying island of Laputa where shades of ancient scholars can be called up. This section is a satire on philosophers and scientists. Scientists are portrayed as men so wrapped up intheir speculations as to be totally useless in practical affairs. Absurd experiments are described (for example, extracting sunlight from cucumbers (but, extracting energy from cucumbers and other plants is no longer so absurd Jonathan)). Also described in this third part are the Struldbergs, men and women who are immortal but who turn out to be miserable and pitiable. In part four, Gulliver travels to the Land of the Houyhnhnms, horses with intelligence but who have no passion or emotion. The word &quot;Yahoo&quot; originates in this part. READ IT!"

The models are heavily based on Lerdahl and Jackendoff's work with preference rules, and may be seen as a test application of that work. Yet designing a computer program that comes to the same result as the human mind is not the same as discovering the process by which the human arrives at that result. That is where the book is highly speculative. Not enough allowance is made for cultural differences in the way music is perceived, nor for the influence bodily experience of music has on its perception which must of necessity be missing from a computer model. Still, the book is an interesting read for the questions it raises, and for the possibilities it puts forth."
B000N6R4AA,NEW EARTH,,A39TBI9EPU3KNC,Valerie W. Stasik,4/4,3.0,1213056000,"Truth but a Rehash of Hinduism, Budhism, and C.S. Lewis","There is unquestionably truth in A New Earth, however, it's not a very accessible read, and I am grateful that the book was loaned to me. As many other reviewers have stated, it's pretty much a rehash of Hinduism, Budhism, and also C.S. Lewis. In one of his books, C.S. Lewis states that our only connection to Eternity is now.(Perhaps Lewis got that from the Hndus and Budhists as well, or perhaps spritual teachers arrive at the same conclusion.) And, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to conclude that fear truly is the root of all evil. These same ideas of the ego (lower self) and being in the moment are espoused by Deepak Chopra. Another book that readers might find more accessible is the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.The ego-- cant' live with it; can't live without it. Since we exist on this plane where the ego is very much present, many of us need a more organized and concrete presentation to satisfy the ego so that we can actually bypass it and become conscious. When something is presented in such an esoteric way, many people who are becoming conscious may not be able to wrap their minds around it. That being said, there are many voices who reach different people. Many find something in this book that speaks to them and that is a good thing. Much of it resonated with me, but that's because I had aleady been exposed to these ideas from other sources. Others will go elsewhere for a voice they understand. Hopefully, we're all the better for the ""teachers"" we find."

It's a story about Scarlett O'Hara, the belle of Clayton County, who falls in love with a man already engaged. She marries another man for spite, and, when he dies, she marries yet another in order to financially support her family farm. All this while, Scarlett is still deeply in love with the man she can not have.

I am tired of both, because as much as it is handy to refer to computer data storage as &quot;memory,&quot; it really is nothing like human memory, and as much as my mother sees ghouls of Alzheimer's over every lost pen, the truth is that her memory isn't as good as, well, as she remembers it being.Without being about pathology, this book is about the fallibility of memory; or rather I should say, the failure of memory to live up to the expectations that we have for it. Actually, this book has made me think about the purpose and function of memory, and I've concluded that it actually works rather well; if we had little videocameras in our frontal lobes, they wouldn't serve us as well as the memory functions we actually have, and in fact, this is the subject of the final chapter.The seven &quot;sins&quot; of memory are transience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias and persistence.Transience is the deterioration of memory over time, other than traumatic memory-- Persistence is the stubbornness of traumatic memory to fade. Absent-mindedness is failure to pay attention to something unusual that happens while performing a task by rote. Misattribution is attributing one feature of a memory to another-- remembering a childhood friend by his dog's name, for example. Blocking is the &quot;tip of the tongue&quot; phenomenon. Bias is coloring old memories with present knowledge.There is no branch of study, from cranial anatomy, to neurochemistry, to performance psychology, to forensics, that he does not probe for usefulness. I applaud him for undertaking this project. In general, his writing is clear and concise. If occasionally he seems to belabor a point, this is something his editors should have corrected, and I don't take him to task for it. Skim through and go on."

A revised version of historical events is proposed, and some intriguing solutions offered to some unanswered questions.The authors argue their points so confidently that the less sceptical reader might be convinced by everything they read. The purpose of this text is to present a new theory, rather than consider the opposing arguments. The reader should explore other sources for additional evidence to balance the author's arguments.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in secret societies, history, or religion - especially freemasonry, ancient Egypt, Christianity, or the knights templar.You'll enjoy reading this fascinating book and perhaps learn a little bit of history too."

The stench of death is more of an echo, a meta-feeling. But it is there. Make no mistake. I walked into the old barracks where emaciated Jews were often lifted like pale wafers and tossed into unspeakable piles. I stood in the gas chambers where they gathered to be bathed by death instead of water ...I believe to favorably review such a mammoth literary achievement as, ""Night,"" one must inevitably delve into a plaguing question: Why would one celebrate, immortalize, horrific detritus of the most evil mountain of human history? If you do not understand the immediate answer, the only answer, to this question, than you have not read ""Night.""Wiesel's triumphant literary accomplishment here is more than the haunting descriptions, the history-staining and memory-tattooing images, the story of austere survival, of hope as if a tiny diamond entombed by an endless black swamp yet still impossibly catching a ray of the moon; it is the idea, the human song, the greatness of the human spirit ... all reminding us, in one sitting's reading, that the most noble truths of the human family are found in our darkest of hours. ""Night"" is really day, whether concentration camp survivors lived to see it with their corporeal eyes, or through the gentle, reverberating eyes of one of our greatest fathers of humanity, Elie Wiesel.... a dog-eared, gaunt paperback, gracing my meager mantel, shall be read long after Wiesel, and you and I, are long gone ... lest we forget what being human is really all about."

B000IOF5BW,My Life on Mars: A Novel,,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""",4/9,3.0,1144108800,"""Children are not reliable witnesses.""","Eliza White, a successful author/illustrator of children's books, is facing a familiar mid-life issue, her ageing mother relocating to New Mexico after the death of her husband of fifty years. On the home front, Eliza is faced with the empty nest syndrome, her three children off to college and, one more time, a philandering husband who has never really engaged in the parenting of their children. Skilled in the art of denial, a legacy of her childhood, Eliza uses her mother's plea for help in sorting through years of accumulation to flee her Santa Fe home and return to the Midwest of her early years, there to be assaulted by unexpected memories. In this common family drama, grown children view their parents through an altered perspective, reliving childhood issues and coming to terms with the responsibility of creating one's own future.Eliza is challenged in all these areas, her quest for attention from a distant father the motivation of her adult choices. Now that her father is gone, Eliza examines her hard-held beliefs, especially in light of a seventy-eight-year old mother's increasing frailty. The battle is engaged, old issues revived in the sorting of memorabilia, including a revelation that her father had a secret he carried to his grave. Unfortunately for Eliza's marriage, she meets an attractive man while at her mother's, a man who reawakens her passion for life. Her resentments flaring, Eliza breaks with her husband over the phone, his infidelities finally too much to bear. This facile resolution of such a conflict fails to meet the standards of a truly evolving woman, who should confront her marital difficulties before plunging into another relationship (Dr. Phil would not approve).There is one other problem with this novel: Eliza's mother is seventy-eight and the daughter forty-three, certainly still prime time for a life change such as Eliza considers. By writing this character young and still attractive, the author sidesteps some of the real issues of mid-life divorce, creating instead a romantic fantasy, Eliza's future hardly dismal. This is escapist fiction and enjoyable for that reason, but expect romance not inspiration as Eliza overcomes her difficulties. Luan Gaines/ 2006."

The simplicity of Steinbeck's writing allows readers to fully comprehend his descriptions and ideas on life's realities. John Steinbeck's use of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel illustrates the imperfection that lies within the realities of life and how that imperfection ultimately gives Man the opportunity to dicate choose the style of life for oneself. As many people might think East of Eden is a boring novel with no excitment, on the contrary, East of Eden is a page turning novel that takes the reader on to the edge with unexpcted twists and turns during the novel's most exciting moments. East of Eden examines how life is never how it is planned. Life will never follow the perfection that is envisioned, but it is through the imperfections in life that Steinbeck reveals that makes it so close to reality, a reality where everyone has flaws and no one is capable of abandoning those flaws."

When I began eating raw, I only had a small kitchen blender and a food processor. A book like this would have overwhelmed me with the more complicated recipes and the need for a dehydrator and Vitamix, which I didn't have. But after getting my feet wet with raw foods, I was looking to make more gourmet and ""wow"" recipes, and I eventually got a dehydrator, Vitamix and juicer. This book came along at the right time. I have numerous raw food recipe and information books, but for amazing recipes, this is my favorite. There is not one thing I have made that is not outstanding. The cocoa buckwheaties cereal with almond milk is a staple with my kids, and the chocolate pudding is amazing. I've seen numerous complaints about the need for expensive equipment and complicated recipes, but for people who have been eating raw foods for a little while and have this equipment, they may be ready for a book like this.

As such, this novel is more in the style of king than in the more raw style that I found in the other earlier Bachman books.Thinner is a great ""revenge"" novel. The story moves quickly and the main character's race against time keeps the pages turning at a fairly rapid pace. The nice thing about this one is that, in true King fashion, nobody is truly safe and almost everyone, in some way, truly deserves what they get in the end.I really did enjoy this one and, though it's not amongst King's very best, it's right there on the second tier. It's a fun book (and the movie follows the novel fairly accurately) that I'll most probably enjoy again someday."

After recently slogging through most of the pre-Hobbit works (e.g. the Silmarillion, Chidren of Hurin, etc.) it was refreshing to re-visit the easy-to-read Hobbit. The book runs through the story of how Bilbo Baggins ended up with the One Ring around which the events of The Lord of the Rings revolve - though it really is a small plot element when compared with the adventures the characters have in enchanted woods, dark caves, dragon hordes, elven dungeons, and battlefields that occur in the rest of the book. The book gives a wonderful introduction to Tolkien's universe and weaves a spellbinding tapestry of sorcery and adventure that provides a great prologue to Tolkien's greatest work. A short and easy read (especially compared to Tolkien's other works) that I've added to my short list of books that I read again and again. A wonderful afternoon escape that almost everyone will love...let's just hope the upcoming pair of movies does it justice."

Not only are the plot, and characters horrible, but Card must have felt he needed to add mentions of mens nakedness throughout the book, and use horrible lanugage. I tried to read this, really tried to like it but, I hated it! Very disappointed!!"
B000HT5FGS,We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book),,A30ZPSYOGFJXR6,Manola Sommerfeld,2/2,4.0,1020988800,Karmic JCO,"JCO is not an author for everyone. She can be so detailed in her descriptions and focus on minute items and spend pages and pages on them. I happen to love the way she writes, but understand that many people do not have the patience to deal with this.I can see how diehard fans of JCO resent her for writing this novel. I can also see how this book was chosen to be an Oprah selection. I got through its 454 pages at times loving it and at times hoping for a near end. Here's the positives:The demise of the family has a very karmic feel to it. Corinne comes through as a very haughty woman despite her Christian beliefs. Michael Sr. places a very high value on status, and wants to be accepted by those he perceives as ""worthy"". If Corinne had been a little bit more like Michael and viceversa, the family would have survived (and then we would have no book!).There is a big element of surprise throughout the story. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, it does.Character development is perfect, to the point that you get to intimately know everybody in the book. The parents and the children all have important roles, except for Michael Jr., the least relevant.Horror is a difficult genre. For horror to be truly successful, it must be unexpected. The banishment of Marianne by her loving and adoring parents after her rape is one of the most horrific moments in JCO's works. What exquisite cruelty! Michael Sr., himself banished from his family and deeply hurt by it, inflicts the same pain on his own fresh and blood.Here's the negatives:The book started great, but lost momentum at the end. I was particularly disappointed with the last scene, the 4th of July reunion. JCO is far more sinister than that, but maybe she is tired of writing high-caliber literature that does not have a huge following, and decided to show everybody that she too can write an Oprah bestseller. Good for her.I have a hard time accepting poor grammar and punctuation, even when it is used for the sake of reality. In this case it doesn't fly. Judd is the narrator, and he is a newspaper editor. It is not inconceivable to expect perfect punctuation from him, yet at times commas shine in their absence.All in all, a keeper."

Plot lines are closing or advancing to the final book, characters are deepening. You feel almost part of the world that Mr. Jordan is creating.I really never cared about reading until one day a friend suggested the WOT. So I picked it up and have been hooked ever since. There is parts in the series that I personally do not like but I know this is the same for everyone. Maybe not jiving with a couple of characters here and there but, isn't that part of life? All in all this is the best book so far.We are finally coming to the end of this monstrous story. I am going to be sad to see it go. I hope Mr. Jordan writes at least a 2,500 page novel for the final book. Anything less would not do the story justice.To all of you that have yet to read the WOT pick up the ""Eye of the World"".

Just finished reading it and like another &quot;reviewer&quot; I would read for awhile, put it down and determine I COULD not finish it. I grew up in a time when money and jobs were REALLY scarce so I wonder about these people who are so very poor. Know there are many like them but do they have to be, with all that is available out there. I guess my thinking is Grisham's book would have been more realistic had it been written about &quot;The Big Depression Era&quot; rather than a time when there were jobs and help available. I am not in great sympathy with the &quot;poor me&quot; syndrome which seems so prevalent in this great nation, and this book seems to almost &quot;glorify&quot; the people who are really ne'er do wells.

Species relations are slowly starting to improve, but tensions between humans and other magical creatures are still high and there is a long history of persecution and death. This murder has the potential to set progress back to the burning times. If it's not solved quickly, it will definitely threaten the passage of the Species Citizenship Bill, a bill that not only would classify Lupi and others as nonhuman, but would grant them full citizenship rights as nonhuman. The Nokolai clan supports the bill, embraces the changes inherent in its passing, but others are less happy and long to exterminate the Lupi from the planet. Solving the murder of Carlos Fuentes may be the only way to keep both sides from exploding.Rule Turner, Lu Nuncio and heir apparent to the Nokolai clan is being framed for the murder, of that much Lily is certain, but knowing it and proving it are two very different things, and when a second body turns up and Lily touches the body to feel the magic of the scene, she realizes that a simple murder case has just gotten immensely more complicated and dangerous. The second victim appears to have been killed by a Lupi, like Fuentes, but underneath the ""feel"" of werewolf magic is the slick, putrid sense of a sorcery so malignant that it can only mean an Old One is meddling in conspiracy, murder, and politics. And in that case, no one is safe.Eileen Wilks kicks off this solid urban fantasy series with a unique blend of police procedure, werewolf culture, and Asian flavor, throws in a bit of magic, mystery, and romance, and ends up with an original story full of complex, likable characters, and a layered plot with intriguing twists and turns.Unlike so many urban fantasy heroines lately, Lily is a short, slight woman of Asian descent, relatively new to homicide and aware of the struggles inherent in working with the boys club of the police department. She's not a leather-wearing, shotgun-toting, inked and scarred badass heroine with all the answers. She solves murders the old fashioned way - connecting the dots of evidence and putting in the legwork. A tragic event in her past has molded her into the cop she is today, and family and cultural influence has an impact on the woman she has grown to be. She is a breath of fresh air in the genre, with realistic reactions to difficult and surprising situations. Imperfect, sure, with a stubborn streak a mile wide, an independent streak an inch wider, and an absolute lack of personal life because she eats, sleeps, and breathes the job. She's got trust issues, and she's not exactly in touch with her emotions. For all that, she's a dedicated, compassionate woman who loves gardening, her grandmother, and her cat. She fights for justice, but would die for the people she cares about. She's normal...with a side order of special.And then there's Rule.Rule Turner is the playboy Lupi prince, Lu Nuncio of his clan and quintessential PR face for his people. He's the image that women swoon for and men want to emulate. Rule, though, is more than an image, more than a randy playboy. He is governed by instincts, culture, and a noble - if wild - sense of right and wrong. He sees Lily Yu, touches her hand, and knows she is his Chosen. To be so gifted changes his life forever. The cultural and nearly religious significance of his kind and their history is doled out in tasty little bites of story goodness, weighty and juicy, and threaded into the plot seamlessly.There is a romantic thread through the book, though its certainly not the focal point, but it's enough to satisfy readers of paranormal romance. Tempting Danger isn't a romance novel, however. It's truly an urban fantasy, with a powerful plot full of danger that has significance on their world stage.The plot is well layered, developing steadily as the characters are introduced and the world defined. The narrative is balanced with satisfying description and exposition, and the police procedural aspects are handled well. There were a few times the investigation felt a little slow to progress, and the pacing dragged a little in places, but overall it was a strong effort. More of a concern for me were the few times when there were abrupt jumps in the story, events beginning, then suddenly they're over and described after the fact. Most notably the final conflict. It's not a particular favorite style of mine, and it tends to disconnect my emotions and upset the story flow.There were so many good points, though, with strong characters that I grew to be very fond of through the story. I was very enamored with the other aspects, as well, especially the slow world building and information sharing as the book progressed. I loved the evolution of the relationship between Lily and Rule, which was both realistic and sweet. This book is full of characters that I cared about, and I'm very pleased that I'll be able to follow along with their lives and stories awhile.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."

Tanizaki's world is one of status, obsessions, cruelty, terror and war.`A portrait of Shunkin' brushes a merciless sadomasochistic painting of a cruel blind music teacher and her pupil - lover. She is a vicious liar in the face of unmistakable evidence, and a jealous woman full of morbid sensitivity and stubborn pride, while being obsessed by her status: `She was ashamed of sleeping with an inferior. (It was) nothing more than a physiological necessity.'`The Bridge of Dreams' evokes the inextricable intimate link between mother and child, `that sweet, dimly white dream world there in her warm bosom among the mingled scents of her hair and her milk.'His mother dies and his father remarries a former geisha, who becomes a substitute for his mother (and her breasts). But, the boy lives in a cruel world: `Ever since Father had married a former entertainer, my relatives had held a hostile attitude toward our family. To put it bluntly, they believed that we were committing incest.'`The Tattooer' `s pleasure lay in the agony men felt as he drove his needles into them, torturing their swollen, blood-red flesh.'`The (professional) Thief' revives his deceitful school years.`Aguri' tells the story of a transformation of a girlfriend through Western clothes.`Terror' analyzes a case of railroad phobia.`A blind man's tale' is a bloody story of predatory shoguns, `cunning men with an eye for women.'Their world is governed by beasts: `no matter how honorably one side behaves, it's useless if the other side won't do the same. Must you really be such a beast to rule the country?'For sure, `ceaseless change is the way of the world, and changes in fortune are especially drastic in times of war.'These tales are an excellent introduction into the world and the writings of J. Tanizaki. For Tanizaki, the world is not a paradise inhabited by rational human beings. To the contrary, mankind's actions are governed by lust for power, physiological (sexual) necessities, revenge, physical and psychological obsessions, personal pride, masochistic and sadistic impulses, abusive interpretations, slander and cunning deceit.Highly recommended and a must read for all Tanizaki fans."

Each story in the book is written by a different author, each sharing his or her own unique inspirational experience. And because each story is written by a different author, they each have their own distinct characteristics. The stories are separated into several categories, just like in the previous Chicken Soup books. Each section offers many stories, and each story is inspiring. In particular, I really enjoyed the story written about the elderly lady who lost her husband and received yellow, long-stemmed roses from him for Valentine's Day after his death. This story, along with the many others in this collection, will surely erase any doubt in those whose belief in true love has weakened. It is not just the content of this book that will keep readers from putting this book down, it is the feeling that one will attain from the stories. It's not all about love and romance, and that is why this book is also well-rounded (although the stories are limited to relationship-related issues). I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I recommend that everyone gives it a try."

If you like love stories, Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas is an awesome book to read! I'm not a big reader, but now that I've read this book, it's my favorite. As soon as I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down.One day Katie was ready to tell her boyfriend that she's pregnant with his child. When her boyfriend, Matt comes home, he tells her that he's leaving. Matt leaves a diary for Katie to read becuase he thought it would explain why he's leaving better than he could. The dairy's title is &quot;Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas.&quot; Suzanne is an older woman who is in her thirties. Suzanne thought she would never fall in love but now that she met the man of her dreams, she's ready to start her future. All Suzanne's life, she wanted to have a kid, but since a traumatic experience she had in her life, she would have major risks in having childeren. Suzanne finds out she's pregnant and she's so happy, but there were many risks she had to take. After Suzanne has her child Nicholas, she finds out another suprise. Many suprising things happen while you read this book. Suzanne has things happen to her, good and bad.Personally, I loved the book. My friend recommended it to me becuase I like reading love stories and diary form books. I don't like reading at all, but when I started reading this, I couldn't put it down. This book is so sweet, while reading this I bet I smiled, cried and said &quot;aww&quot; way too many times.

Reality and simulation melt together seamlessly, without a trace of resistence from the archtypal family whose path we follow as they prepare themselves for a Las Vegas vacation to witness the much hyped Media Event of Bear v. Shark. Bachelder keeps a straight face through out most of this short but punchy novel, and displays an ear for the way television cant infiltrates our daily speech, and invades our dream life. Scattered through out the book are a heap of fast and savage rips on Mass Mediated news, sports call-in shows, flouncy entertainment underwhich nothing substantial resides.In this world, experts in the guise of pundits, jocks, philosophers, and academics all feed aan uncountably intrusive technology that renders every distraction and disturbance into an entertainment value, to be used until a new contrived sequence of illusion can be set in place.Bachelder, demonstrating a brevity and incisive wit that trashes the claims made for the word-gorged ""genius"" of D.F. Wallace, writes surely, sharply, with his eye never off his target.Though he does, at times, resort to the sort of post-modernism stylistics and cliches, such as having the author step out from the story to deliver some self-aware discourse on the limits of narrative's capacity to represent the external world fully, completely -- he has a novel or two to go before the lit.critese is pounded out of him -- our author finally reveals a humane side underneath the smart language, and issues forth a funny yet serious warning about our habit of relinquishing our thinking and our capacity to live imagitively over to the hands of data-drunk programmers.A terrific first effort."

It's thicker than other versions and the print is small, if that is no problem then go ahead and buy it. My version had a few weird quirks like accordian pages and uncut pages which caused it to protrude from the book and there were ink smudges as well.Content wise, I found the book to be well written and I enjoyed Margaret Mitchell's use of imagery. The words flowed, the book was interesting and of course you're going to love Rhett Butler. This isn't a true depiction of slavery and you shouldn't use it as insight into how life was like during the Civil War, although it might give you some idea and it's interesting to read from the Southerner's point of view. Obviously there will be some annoying aspects. I found it difficult to understand the slaves and skimmed through most of their dialogue and of course you might even get annoyed that the slaves were depicted as their most loyal pets that never question their masters and didn't want their freedom.But if you considered what time it was written and by whom, then it shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of your book.

It's an ideology that can be used to justify any militaristic action whatsoever.What does the 'War on Terror' mean? Wake up America, the US has done just as much promotion of 'terrorism' as any other country. It has supplied arms and training to countless foreign guerilla groups, including Osama bin laden and the Taliban, and helped to planned coups and the assasination of foreign leaders (eg. President in Chile in 1973). If this doesn't count as terrorism what does?There are real answers to curtailing fundamentalist Islamic terrorists (like economic aid and education), but overthrowing these Governments and installing American puppet-'democracies' is just going to magnify the resentment.You cannot stop terrorism by the Orwellian-type controls suggested in this book, the only way to stop terrorism is to nullify the reasons why the terrorists are willing to commit these acts in the first place, to remove the cause that they are fighting for."

The deceased's angry adult children, though they inherit a fortune, will protest the will. Because of their attitude and the belief by her father and other uncle that she is incapable of doing the job, Nicole reluctantly agrees to take charge.Nicole moves to Houston where she meets doubt from the work force, opposition from the board, and animosity from her male cousin. She also finds herself attracted to Marcus who reciprocates the feeling as he finds her intelligent. However, someone is using the security systems to steal from clients, placing Nicole in trouble if she fails to uncover the identity of her adversary.This engaging boardroom romance stars two delightful African-Americans and an eccentric support cast, whom readers will cherish. Though Nicole's successful move right into top management (with no supervisory experience) seems stretched; fans will enjoy her efforts as the CEO. Marcus is an intelligent hunk and though his street loyalty to a friend hurts the business and his relationship with the boss, fans will value highly his devotion to his pal and to Nicole though the dualism pulls him in different directions.

The recipes, however, are nearly all flawed in some significant manner in that following them verbatim will result in poor results.

I highly recommend these books to anyone who is on a spiritual or religious quest or may be questioning their own religion or faith. Anyone with a myopic and self-righteous view of a particular traditional religion will most likely take exception to the manner of presentation and views put forth.

B000KA1JCI,Twenty Thousand leagues Under the Sea,,A3H0I8UMCFTWFR,"Plaque ""Plaque""",10/12,5.0,1059609600,Verne's masterwork,"For some reason, even after reading this book, my brain still translates ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" to mean 20000 leagues DOWN instead of a DISTANCE. What's wrong with me?Anyway, this book was a treasure. Jules Verne, the grandfather of science fiction, again shows that his is much more than a scientific mind. Verne is a grand storyteller, and this novel is his masterwork.Our heroes, Professor Arronax, his faithful compatriot Conseil, and the salty sailor Ned Land find themselves together in a hunt for a giant, mysterious undersea creature which has been causing havoc among shipping lines as well as towns along the coastline. Setting out to sea on top-of-the-line sailing vessel, the three men and the crew encounter the creature, only to have it sink their ship like so many others. However, as you probably know, this is no creature at all, but the most spectacular vehicle ever created by man. It is the Nautilus, a gigantic submarine, and the proud creation of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.Captain Nemo holds the three as his prisoner. They are instructed that they may never leave the Nautilus, yet will be treated with hospitality and respect by Nemo and his crew. The Captain keeps his word, and treats the Professor and his fellows to all the wonders of the ocean depths. Captain Nemo has made the sea his home, vowing never to return to the distasteful world on land. The Nautilus has everything you would need to live and prosper; infinite supplies of water through its seawater processing machines, and an abundance of exotic seafood dredged up from the deep.Captain Nemo himself is as mystifying and brilliant as his creations. He is one of the greatest villains ever put on paper, and Verne's skill as a storyteller brings him to life. Nemo's motivations are clouded in mystery. I can't stress enough how excellent this character is, and the sly way Verne allows for Nemo's true motivations to remain as unfathomable at the end of the novel as it was at the beginning.The Professor doesn't want to leave the Nautilus. He is enthralled by the sea life and the wonders of Nemo's brilliant submarine. Conseil goes where the Professor goes, and is pleased to assist him in their adventure. Ned feels like a prisoner. He longs to walk on firm ground again, and considers his imprisonment as a violation.The action is blended well alongside the exploration and discovery. This book reads and feels like a grand adventure in ways few books can equal. The language is crisp and clear and so is the humor, which is a unusual for a novel written well over 100 years ago. It flows perfectly in English as a result of a superb translation. If I were to single out one thing I disliked about it, it would be the detailed discussions of sea life in the undersea world. I still found Verne's descriptions of multitudes of ocean species fascinating, but some readers may not. What helps alleviate the (possible) boredom is to remember that readers back in the 1800 had NO TV and few had any way of experiencing the wonders of the sea as Verne describes them.""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" can be read by all ages. Most of Verne's books are recommended to younger readers, but there is no indication that they were WRITTEN for the young crowd. You certainly never feel like you're reading a children's book, not by a long shot. Anyone with a sense of wonder and appreciates the fantastic would enjoy the ride. I know I did."

B000NW7OEA,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,,A4FNKCZ84FOYF,anemonephile,0/0,5.0,1360713600,Growth Through Growth,"Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an essential read for teen girls learning about their surroundings. This historical fiction, set in early 1900s Brooklyn, leaves readers feeling like they have grown by reading the book. The plot centers around Francie, a girl who grows up with and learns to navigate a dark world.The beginning of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn establishes the poverty Francie Nolan, the protagonist, faces. Evidence of the Nolans' poverty can be found when Smith writes about how Francie enjoys ""their one great luxury,"" wasting coffee: ""From time to time, she'd smell the bitter sweetness of it. That was better than drinking it. At the end of the meal, it went down the sink... Mama explained: `...I think it's good that people like us can waste something once in a while and get the feeling of how it would be to have lots of money and not have to worry about scrounging'""(14). Since Francie's mother, Katie Nolan, likens being wealthy to not worrying about scrounging, you could infer that her family is poor. A middle-class person would think it was normal to live without scrounging. The poverty, and other problems such as Francie's frequently drunken father, creates a challenge for Francie's growth.One of Betty Smith's messages is that in order to grow up, you must understand the world in which you are growing. The tree foreshadows this theme in the beginning. Smith writes about that type of tree, ""You saw a small one of these trees through the iron gate leading to someone's yard and you knew that soon that section of Brooklyn would get to be a tenement district. The tree knew. It came there first""(6). This detail suggests the tree understands poor habitats and that is why it thrives in these places. In the contrast, Francie is initially too innocent to understand the darkness of her life. Her navet&eacute; is demonstrated in the passage, ""Francie made Mama watch while she put the eight cents in the tin-can bank. They had a pleasant five minutes conjecturing about how much was in the bank. Francie thought there must be nearly a hundred dollars. Mama said eight dollars would be nearer right""(12). Francie is too nave at this point to see that her family is poor. She will have to understand the circumstances if she is to succeed as she gets older. The tree symbolizes this requirement and, in that way, sets the stage for Francie's story.Teenage girls who are beginning to understand the realities of life and enjoy pondering these discoveries should read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is about a girl who is challenged to face the facts of her life. The plot would be attractive to another girl facing similar challenges because she could relate to Francie and would learn more about life. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn helps develop readers by vividly portraying Francie's development."

0830832165,The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design,16.5,A23NK6EGOX0LTM,Ruskin,17/34,3.0,1136419200,"Cogent answers to many questions, but not the most important one","This book provides in a very readable question-and-answer format the well-crafted answers to most of the questions about the intelligent design movement. Dembski is at his best when punching holes in the evolutionary biologists' view/defense of the theory of evolution. He shows that the evolution camp does not have nearly enough evidence to prove the case for evolution.However, Dembski does not answer THE question: Even if intelligent design is proven to be true, what does it do for us? Granted, proof of the existence of a creator (or at least some intelligent being that guided the development of complex life) would answer an important metaphysical question. However, it does nothing to address the really weighty questions of metaphysics: Who created the Creator? Is the Creator benign or evil? Is the Creator omnipotent? Or just one of numerous beings in another universe? Does the Creator resemble anything near our conceptions of God or gods? et cetera, et cetera.To Dembski's credit, he asserts that the intelligent design movement's purpose is not to opine on such metaphysical or religious matters. Rather, the purpose is to show that there was an intelligent force behind biological development. Thus, he nicely avoids the entanglement of the design/blind evolution dialectic with the religious baggage that misguidedly accompany that dialectic.But again, that nagging question - even if true, what does ID do for us? - is not addressed. In terms of science, proof that there was/is a Creator does not advance scientific knowledge. Science is about understanding underlying principles. But science can never threaten religion (it is impossible to prove that God does not exist), and the establishment of a Creator does absolutely nothing in helping us to understand the underlying principles that govern our universe, that is, unless you resort to miracles by the Creator (which is essentially what the ID movement is doing) which is tantamount to saying ""it can't be knowable"".Dembski is correct when he points out the gaping holes in the theory of evolution. I believe in evolution not because I think there is any proof (I don't think we have nearly enough), but because it seems to be the most promising theory. The evolutionists are trying to make sense of the world and believe that the underlying principles are knowable through further study. ID, at least as Dembski (and Behe, author of Darwin's Black Box) presents it, seems to be saying ""it is too complicated, so there had to be a intelligent force guiding change, so forget it because you are not going to figure it out."" Ultimately, ID seems to be a more glorified form of humanity's inclination over the millenia to attribute the mysteries of the world (weather, volcanic eruptions, comets, diseases, etc.) to the gods.Science can never discover anything that can possibly threaten the idea of a Creator, and likewise, the proof of a Creator, in and of itself, can do nothing to impact science. That is why Dembski ultimately fails in his attempt to establish ID as a science. It is metaphysics at best."
1559350334,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (BBC Audio Collection),,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,Christopher Culver,1/6,4.0,1078099200,"Good, but approach it as a masterpiece of philology","J.R.R. Tolkien's THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first volume of The Lord of the Rings, the 20th century's most important epic fantasy and a perennial for all ages. It presents a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, as he discovers that a family heirloom is actually a magic ring devised and then lost by a Dark Lord, and then sets off to destroy the ring before it can be seized back. Frodo and his company pass through many parts of Tolkien world of Middle-Earth, filled with many races of mythical beings.There are several ways to approach the work, and for myself the most fulfilling has been from a philological perspective. Tolkien was enamoured with languages of all kinds, and over the course of his life he created many, giving special attention and care to two, Quenya and Sindarin. These two constructed languages are loved by many fans of linguistics, and it is precisely in FELLOWSHIP that we have the most important example of mature Quenya. There are also several important snippets of Sindarin here, especially among place-names.Approaching the work as just good literature will be disappointing, however. Tolkien, a specialist on Anglo-Saxon, tended to write mostly in a faux-archaic style reminiscent of BEOWULF or &quot;The Battle at Maldon&quot;. This tone, outdated and overly simplistic, will soon annoy the reader. Fitting in with the style, cliches and repetition abound. How many times must the reader be told Aragon suddenly seems not ragged anymore, but kingly and proud? Also, there are no narrative illusions here; the plot moves as it is overtly presented. If you like untrustworthy narrators, and thin and nebulous accounts where the reader must carefully fill in the blanks, as is common with such writers as Vladimir Nabokov and Gene Wolfe, Tolkien will seem infantile to you.I do recommend reading THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and even moving on the all of the Lord of the Rings. If you are fond of language, then it will be a fulfilling and eye-opening work. If you are just looking for fine literature to enjoy, however, then it would probably be best to read something by an author with a more modern tone and better academic reception."
0025705504,The Great Divorce,,A2A8JY0MD0RDVG,Dan,1/2,4.0,1053993600,C.S. Lewis and his writing,"We all remember stories of The Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe, about Aslan and his famous victory over the Witch. The Great Divorce was something of a different nature. Lewis still had his ideas about heaven and hell, but they were a bit more obvious. There weren't a lot of undertones as in the children series, but everything he wrote was concrete and it was obvious what his views were. This made the book a lot better and I enjoyed it very much especailly the ending, showing Lewis' rather cruel humor and sense of style. If anyone likes Lewis I recommend this book and I would also recommend The Screwtape Letters. Then if you enjoyed Screwtape I would recommend This Present Darkness and it's sequel Piercing the Darkness by Frank Peretti."

B0006DJUXE,DOCTOR THORNE - TWO VOL. SET.,,A34UTL4AVX80MK,Mary E. Sibley,0/0,5.0,1250121600,Blood or money,"John Newbold Gresham is the Member from Barsetshire, a Tory. When he dies, his son, Francis Gresham, is chosen in his place. He has married Lady Arabella DeCourcy, a Whig family, and so after the dissolution of Parliament, he fails to maintain his seat.There are many children, mostly girls, except for the eldest, another Frank. By 1854 the son has been educated at Harrow and is attending Cambridge. Dr. Thorne lives at Greshamsbury with his niece, Mary Thorne. Mary is educated with Lady Arabella's daughters, Augusta and Beatrice Gresham. She studies French, German, and music. The squire of Greshamsbury struggles with debt and poverty. Dr. Thorne arranges his loans for him with Sir Roger Scratcherd.Augusta accepts Mr. Moffat's offer of marriage. (This later comes to nothing.) Mary makes the DeCourcy cousins angry with her as Augusta's wedding is planned. Lady Amelia, his aunt, declares that Frank must marry money, (to save his patrimony). Nearly simultaneously Mary Thorne learns enough of her dubious beginnings to understand that she is duty-bound to discourage Frank's romantic leanings in her direction.As things develop, Mary is banned from visiting Gresham family members, and her uncle, in sympathy, decides to limit his involvement with the family to professional matters. Much of the plot is in the nature of a Cinderella or Romeo and Juliet story. I do not mean that Trollope needed models for his plots, just that in cases of matrimony, the issues of money and blood arose often.This is a smashing book."

This book is meant to distinguish good between evil, so read it to your children and let them read it. No harm will be done. I believe it is 1,008 pages, but well worth the time and trouble.

1556851898,Of Human Bondage [UNABRIDGED] (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection),44.99,AKIB86S00AP37,"Shaimaa Fayed ""Shaimaa Fayed""",7/11,3.0,1106524800,"Good stuff @ 1st, but bondage to finish the entire thing !!","Im not about to completely bash one of the twentieth century's most celebrated novels. In fact, I did learn a good deal from this massive bildungsroman. However, before I get to the perks of the work, I have to admit that I absolutely waded and ploughed through the second half of the book, and I still couldnt finish it. I tried to exercise some self-discipline and force myself to read a few more chapters everyday, but at some point I felt I was battling against all odds, and I gave up. It is not the size of the work which irked me at all, but rather the repetitive tedium of the story and the unneccessary details. For example, the section covering Phillip's life in Paris...honestly, this was not autobiography by any means, it was just a long, endless dissertation on the art-world of the 19th century...every artist, every nuance of color and design, every stroke of the paintbrush, was spoken about ad nauseum....Cezanne versus El Greco, Manet versus Vermeer van Delft, this artist versus the other, I was losing my mind !!And the petty details of the characters that surround Phillip...I learnt what Cronshaw ate every single day of his sordid life, how many times Griffiths visited the bathroom, how many bottles of beer Flanagan sipped, what their shoes looked like, their coats, their breath....all those details were such a distraction from the essence of the novel.And Mildred !! Could there exist a more despicable person on the face of the earth?? She is so selfish and artificial and cheap to the point of being two-dimensional. Yes, it is true that humans can become infatuated with the people who mistreat them....such is our sorry nature. Those who are indifferent to us attract our attention, and this is often the basis of obsessive love, as was the case with Phillip. But Mildred is just too much. Every human vice is embedded in this ""green""-skinned anorexic heroine. She is the epitomy of hypocrisy, materialism, shallowness, vindictiveness, stupidity, ignorance, etc, etc, etc.Now to the essence of the story......the perks I mentioned earlier......as a novel of self-discovery there's much to commend in ""Of human bondage"". I learnt so so much, chiefly that over the course of the centuries, human curiosity has not altered much. What Phillip went through in his growing years is not much different than what we go through now in our own growing years. The doubts about authority and God, established rules and established religion, the discovery of love, the search for the meaning of our lives, well it has been the same cycle since the dawn of time !! It amazed me how much I could relate to a character like Phillip, a product of the 19th century, while I am now alive more than a 100 years later.I was also amazed at how much connection there is between all fine literature across the realm of time. I saw a lot of resemblance between the character of Phillip in ""bondage"" and that of Dino in Alberto Moravia's ""boredom."" Both are obsessed by women whom they can not completely possess. They are driven to self-humiliation by the women who refuse to love them. I also found a similarity between Phillip's philosophy of life in this novel and the philosophy that Coelho was trying to put forward in ""Veronika decides to Die."" Phillip's philosophy is ""follow your inclinations with due regard to the policeman around the corner."" In Veronika, Coelho also concedes that we should live our lives as we please, and satisfy our erratic needs, but with regard to the law and the harmony of society. Do what you want without harming others or yourself, in other words.I think the bulk of the book is useful to read, I highlighted many quotes, and was fascinated with the way in which Maugham presents Phillip's foibles and weaknesses. Phillip is so human, so real, and therefore alive. I learnt a lot from him, most important of which is that though sometimes we err badly, there is no use in regret. Unless our mistakes are fixable, it is useless to brood over them....just forget, what happened happened and the past is unreturnable.Another memorable quote in my head: ""procrastination is the thief of time""......makes me want to get off my behind and start doing the things Ive been procrastinating my entire life, because time is always slipping from our hands!!I also learnt one particular new word from this book, I could swear it was used at least 1000 times throughout the novel...""taciturn."" X was taciturn, Y was taciturn, z was taciturn, everyone was pretty taciturn in this novel :)PS: The ideas of the book are fabulous but Im just so angry with all the tedious descriptions and repetitions, because I really wanted to finish the novel till the end and just couldnt do it !! Thats why I only gave it three stars. I tried to read the last small segment, I swear I really REALLY tried !! But in utter vain. Already by page 400 I was at my wit's end. I think that the only way I could have finished the book is if someone had strapped me to my bed and held me at gunpoint. At the end of the day, intelligent literary ramblings teach us a lot, but, Mr. Maugham, entertainment value is important too !!!!"

My favorites among his books I have reread a dozen times. They happen to be, if anyone is interested, The Green Hills of Earth and the Man Who Sold the Moon. Stranger in a Strange Land is a book which is certainly controversial in its views, but it works! Starship Troopers has controversial views as well but they are so simplistic that they don't work at all. I have nothing against his basic premise that to be a citizen you have to have fought for your country, though it's a tad extreme. His example of Marxism not working because a bad baker can ruin a pie and make worthless it's ingredients. which initially had value - OK, I'll buy that. But when he compares mid 20-th century child rearing to raising a puppy, he falls flat on his face. Babies are not puppies, and parents who don't use a strap are not stupid, hopeless or ignorant as he suggests. He may have a bone to pick with over indulgence. But not all 'spare the rod' child rearing is overindulgent as he implies and says right out. In this instance he was lazy and made do with a bad analogy and exaggeration to make his point. Frankly I was sufficiently disgusted with this really amateurish example that I put down the book and read no further."

I found it to be very easy to read. Suzanne kept her focus on how she felt this way of eating made sence to her and why. I must admit I wasn't too sure that it was going to work. At this poiint in my life I guess I felt I didn't have too much to lose, or I should I say I had a lot to lose weight wise. I have always had problems with how my body would digest or not digest food. I can not eat certain things without a severe reation, now I understand why. These foods are on the do not eat list, avocados, bananas, peanut butter. If I would even take a bite of any of these foods I would end up at the hosptial in terrible pain. I also have suffered from other problems related to how my colon functioned or didn't function. Without going into any detail I will just say it was always something I had to think about and deal with whenever I ate period. I got to the point where I didn't even want to go out to eat in fear of what might happen. I can honestly say that not only have I lost 40lbs. but my quality of life has improved greatly. Nobody wants to talk about these types of difficulties but I felt it was important. I know there has to be other people out there that go through these same kind of things. I hope by putting these things out there that maybe someone might be able to be helped in the same way I was. To me losing the weight was just icing on the cake. Learning to eat this way is not difficult. Some of the things I have given up are things I loved to eat, potatoes, gravey, white bread, but the benifits are far more important and I don't ever feel like I'm dieting or going hungry. I will be able to eat like this for the rest of my life and be happy with it. I just want to say thank you to Suzanne Sommers for writing this book. My life is better because of it."

""","Edward Abbey, a well-known author and environmental activist, once said, ""Sentiment without action is the ruin of the soul"". Carson obviously felt similarly, and expressed her extreme passion for nature, the earth, living things, and the environment in her compelling book, Silent Spring. Carson was one who would not remain silent, or go without action. She boldly alerted the public to the poisons and dangers we are dispersing into the world. Carson's writing reveals her concern for everything that has been done to the earth, and will be done in the future. However, it also shows the hope that someday instead of pouring chemicals deemed intolerable and poisonous for humans by the FDA into our environment, natural and safer solutions will be sought and widely used for the same reasons. This book served as both a wonderful, thought-provoking read, as well as a terrible realization. I enjoyed how with each page I read, a myriad of questions arose forcing the reader to think about the distinctions between animals and man, the interconnected web of life, the silent and deadly killers eating away at the environment, and how we let it get this far. Despite the fact that this book was written in the early 1960's, it still teaches several valuble lessons to every reader. Since that time many advances in methodology, technology, and science have been made to alleviate many of the problems discussed in this book, but the damage has been done. Much of the environment will never be the same, and it's important to understand why. What is more powerful than a book to inform the unaware! Being born far after the time when the book was released, and the environmental movement began, this book has been a key tool in helping me to understand man's capacity to poison, kill, and destroy, as well as his amazing capability to understand, learn, help, teach, and try to change and fix what has been done."

Thinking it would be an intriguing look into the way things are marketed to us, I bought the book. Vance and his publisher want you to believe that this is a shocking expose of the advertising industry but I doubt even he believes his assertion. Perhaps these were revolutionary techniques in the 50s but they certainly aren't relevant now. Does it require a psychologist to tell us that we all want a convertible and leave with a sedan? That you'd rather have a cake mix that requires eggs and milk instead of just water? That you want to indulge in a guilty pleasure but need to be reassured first? That sex sells? It's armchair psychology and nothing in the book is shocking or surprising.Even the publisher doesn't take this release seriously -- it clearly skipped the editor's desk and went straight to press typo's and all.

B0006EOB6Y,Wise blood,,A1REA4SQZVGHI4,Michelle,18/20,5.0,957571200,The Undermining Themes of Wise Blood,"Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood contains many reoccuring and undermining religious themes. Her main theme includes the redemption of man by Christ. She also depicts the grotesques in society through her use of her subject matter. O'Connor bluntly uses this religious theme to prove that redemption is difficult for her characters because of the distorted sense of moral purpose in her characters. Throughout her novel, a major emphasis is placed on materialsim and money. Through her use of imagery, symbols, and details, O'Connor produces the unbalanced prosperity of the society, which leaves little assurance to blissfulness in life.Her protagonist, Hazel Motes, becomes a fated preacher or even prophet; however, Hazel rejects any form of Christ in his life including the image of himself. Even though it is rejected, his fate dominates him throughout the novel, and via his rejection of Christ, Hazel preaches the Church without Christ. Hazel finds that his reason for existence is to form the Church without Christ. Eventually, Hazel sacrifices everything in his life so as to not accept Christ which eventually destroys him. It would have been much better to sacrifice everything he had to begin with in order to accept Christ and let Christ take over from there. This would have prevented Hazel's destruction rooted from his rejection of Christ. This proves O'Connor's purpose of showing a society full of people who cannot accept Christ and who are, at most times, destroyed in some way in their attempt to reject their religious side.O'Connor mocks evangelism and the all too popular &quot;preachers for profits,&quot; who have no training in religion what so ever, in order to display her scorn for popularized anti-cerebral religion. Hazel, whose name is actually Hebrew for &quot;he who sees God,&quot; ironically but purposefully covers himself with a figurative veil. This veil covers his soul and his senses from seeing Christ as He should be seen. His nickname, Haze, also proves his inability to see clearly.Throughout this novel, Hazel runs into several people who perform mysterious acts of goodness for him trying to help Hazel find Grace. This is also ironic condiering that most of Hazel's acquaintances are profiteer preachers. Some of these acquaintances include: Asa Hawks, an ex-evangelist, who pretends to blind himself for sympathy and profit as he &quot;hawks&quot; for money around the city; Enoch Emery, the boy with &quot;wise blood,&quot; who cannot find his inner self and becomes Hazel's follower in the Church without Christ; and Hoover Shoats, another profiteer preacher, who pretends to agree with Hazel's beliefs just to gain profit from it.Haze's car is a major sumbol of the novel. This car becomes Hazel's &quot;church.&quot; Hazel lives in his car and preaches from his car. His car becomes the &quot;rock&quot; which Hazel builds his church upon. He and his car become &quot;one.&quot; After his car is destroyed, Hazel sees himself as destroyed. Hazel is weaned out of his fantasy/rejection world and into reality. He eventually forces himself to Christ as he sees he is &quot;not clean.&quot; He begins his stage of repentance by blinding himself, stuffing his shoes with glass and rocks, and wrapping barbed wire around his chest. Inevitably, his destruction came.This book was very revealing and well-written. O'Connor selects certain audences with the books she wrote. This book contains a majority of religion. A person who perfers not to read about religion probably ought to but will not want to. The way O'Connor incorporated her hidden themes into her novel provided the reader several ways to interpret her implied religious beliefs."

Schrader.Additionally, the book details the founding of the first three chapters, and then proceeds to describe the founding of every subsequent chapter through and including Nu Beta chapter.Finally, there is a short biography section on 24 important members of the fraternity, as well as listings of every member of the Executive Council over the years. The book concludes with a toast by Founder Schrader at the Installation of Omega Chapter (03/26/1932).Overall, this is a great resource for the fraternity. However, its age is beginning to show as many chapters have been installed in the period since 1980. This book would make a great resource for anyone looking to expand Theta Tau's history."

B000TZCSE2,I Am Legend,,A1LMBM1N4EXS5W,"thepaxdomini ""The Book Review""",2/2,4.0,1208304000,I AM LEGEND by Richard Matheson,"I Am Legend is Richard Matheson's short novel about the only survivor of a plague that has made everyone else on earth into something like zombie vampires. It is a foundational novel in the post-apocalyptic genre of science fiction and horror, and has been made into a movie three times: The Last Man on Earth (1964), with Vincent Price, The Omega Man (1971), with Charlton Heston, and I Am Legend (2007), with Will Smith. Of these, The Last Man on Earth follows the novel most closely.Matheson's style often seizes on the mundane details of the situation, at times without apparent value to the story, but the overall effect is suspenseful, in large part because Matheson takes the reader inside the main character Neville's mental imbalance. Throughout the book, Neville is not only in danger from the vampires, but also from himself.This edition contains ten Matheson short stories, ranging in genre from horror to suspense. None of them are as good as I Am Legend, but a few of them are genuinely creepy and others show Matheson's knack for exploring the disturbed minds of his characters. The reader will also notice a few of Matheson's writing preferences (he loves to use the word ""funereal"", and he frequently describes characters' mouths as ""gashes"").Like or not, books like I Am Legend are responsible for the now over-played zombie genre. Here, at least, it's done originally, and done well.RECOMMENDED"

I did expect to be reasonably entertained. I found instead that the stories were actually boring and dull. What is the difference between these stories and the Retief stories of the early 1960s? For one thing, while the earlier stories were satirical, they were also space opera. They poked fun in a light, entertaining manner. The later stories are all satire, with little adventure. The satire is heavy-handed and aimed at obvious targets, and the stories are much too long. The earlier Retief stories tended to be short, tight novelettes. The stories in this collection (""Retief in the Ruins,"" ""There is a Tide,"" and ""The Woomy"" ) are all overwritten novellas. Too bad, too bad. Laumer wrote a lot that was much better."

I am a college student with little &quot;true&quot; cooking experience, however I found this book to be fairly easy to follow and have had a lot of success with the recipes I have tried so far. I would describe this book as &quot;beginner gourmet&quot; in that some of the recipes are a bit fancy and require longer preparation time, yet others are easier and simpler to make. Today I made the London cheesecake, which turned out to be incredible. I have made the Espresso cupcakes several times of which they have always turned out really well. The Molten Chocolate Babycakes was the very first recipe I made from this book, which was also very good (highly recommend for chocolate lovers). I had a bit of difficulty with the cheese blintzes because they were pretty tedious for an inexperienced cook to make; however for a first try they did turn out pretty good. In the future I would love to make the peanut butter/chocolate squares, the rocky road and the easy almond cake. This book contains several full color photographs of the recipes, which helps me know what the recipes are supposed to look like. The book is well organized into sections such as; chocolate, children (contains simpler recipes such as cupcakes, birthday cake, the rocky road, etc...)cakes, cookies scones and muffins, bread, Christmas, etc... The only complaint that I have regards the accessability to some of the ingredients in some of the more complicated (yet very appealing) recipes. For example, I would love to attempt the Torta Alla Gianduia (the photo is a definite seller), however it calls for Nutella, a rich chocolate hazelnut spread of which I do not know where to find it. I must also mention that while this book focuses on deserts, it is not soley exclusive to them. There are recipes for bagels, pizza, jam and bread. Some of the recipes do not sound very appealing to me such as Figs in Rum Syrup, Muscat Jelly (of which I don't know what muscat is), pickled plums, Gin and Tonic Gelatin Mold, and mincemeat pie, but this is purely opinion. Overall I rate this book as excellent, especially for those of you wishing to learn more about cooking, as well as experienced chefs. I think this book is a happy medium for people at all levels and I highly recommend it."

It is a wonderful, easy read that will take you out of your busy world.

Duplicates of each... one in the house for planning and study, one in the truck. Occasionally I rotate them so they don't wear out too quickly.If you spend a lot of time in the back country these maps are the best alternative, from my point of view. It's true the maps don't have labels on the back country cow trails another reviewer complained of. The fact is, neither do the roads. But it's often helpful when you come to the fork in a dirt two-track and they both wander off a few degrees off North, to be able to crack open the Delorme and discover the one on the left plays out just over that hill over there at a windmill. There's no excuse for needing labels these days. A compass and Delorme will allow you to locate yourself in most instances.However, even the back woods purist ought to own a GPS. I've been wandering around the back woods longer than most readers of this have been alive. I rarely get lost, but I frequently don't know exactly where I am. Occasionally my old TrailBlazer saved me a lot of walking to get back to the truck. Once it saved my life in a snowstorm, I imagine.For motor traveling you'll cover too much ground to allow the 7.5 minute maps to help much. You pass from one map to the next too quickly. When you are afoot a couple of them become useful. Meanwhile, I use Delorme as one of the ways to keep track of my wanderings. I recommend them wherever you are. And a GPS, as well."

I strongly identified with several of the characters within the story which at times made the book difficult to put down. This was the first Ayn Rand book I've read but I can't honestly say that I'd ever read another one.Rand seems to have an aversion towards writing as people speak. Significant parts of the book are dedicated towards various soapbox orations by the characters. Real people in the same situation may have a relatively brief conversation that covers all the bases; Rand's characters go on and on (and on and on and on...) covering not only all of the bases but also all of the gridirons, courts, greens, and raceways. It gets monotonous very quickly. You will find yourself skipping ahead several paragraphs (or pages) just to get to the end of an oration which could have been nicely and clearly summarized with significantly less effort. At times this is EXTREMELY painful to wade through. Such attention to detail is better suited towards a technical writer, not to an author of fiction.That said, the story was great but the writing is in serious need of better editing. Rand needs either a severe lesson in the efficiency of brevity, or a new editor that isn't afraid to cut out a few hundred pages of soapbox oration."
B000MS82OQ,Mere Christianity,,A2VE83MZF98ITY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""",37/37,5.0,1129852800,Superb collection,"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.This collection contains several of C.S. Lewis' classic works (although it is not in fact a complete collection of all his writings, not even of all his non-fiction writings). It contains the following works: 'Mere Christianity', 'The Screwtape Letters', 'The Great Divorce', 'The Problem of Pain', 'Miracles', 'A Grief Observed', plus 'The Abolition of Man'. It does provide an excellent survey of Lewis' theology, ethics, and general outlook on life. I will highlight two of the selections that show the different ways Lewis approaches things.For the first example, the book 'Mere Christianity' looks at beliefs, both from a 'natural' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, 'When I was an atheist...' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the `leave it to God' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God's own personality. Lewis' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God's is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the `new man' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.'Mere Christianity' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - 'The Case for Christianity', 'Christian Behaviour', and 'Beyond Personality'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made.On the other hand, Lewis can write in ways that are intensely personal and reflective. This is true of the book 'A Grief Observed'. This was drawn out of his personal experience with his wife, Joy. C.S. Lewis was a confirmed bachelor (not that he was a 'confirmed bachelor', mind you, just that he had become set enough in his ways over time that he no longer held out the prospect of marriage or relationships). Then, into his comfortable existence, a special woman, Joy Davidson, arrived. They fell in love quickly, and had a brief marriage of only a few years, when Joy died of cancer.This left Lewis inconsolable.For his mother had also died of cancer, when he was very young.Cancer, cancer, cancer!Lewis goes through a dramatic period of grief, from which he never truly recovers (according to the essayist Chad Walsh, who writes a postscript to Lewis' book). He died a few years later, the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.However, Lewis takes the wonderful and dramatic step of writing down his grief to share with others. The fits and starts, the anger, the reconciliation, the pain--all is laid bare for the reader to experience. So high a cost for insight is what true spirituality requires. An awful, awe-ful cost and experience.'Did you know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past...'All that was good paled in comparison to the loss. How can anything be good again? This is such an honest human feeling, that even the past is no longer what is was in relation to the new reality of being alone again.In the end, Lewis reaches a bit of a reconciliation with his feelings, and with God.'How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back. She said not to me, but to the chaplain, ""I am at peace with God."" 'Lewis had a comfortable, routine life that was jolted by love, and then devasted by loss. Through all of this, he took pains to recount what he was going through, that it might not be lost, that it might benefit others, that there might be some small part of his love for Joy that would last forever.I hope it shall.This is a wonderful collection."
186450174X,Lonely Planet Barcelona City Map (City Maps),,A2MOBMVHECYVLE,saliero,51/51,4.0,1171152000,Sound guide to a fanbulous city,"I went to Barcelona recently, and in the planning of the trip I consulted four guide books:Lonely Planet's Barcelona City GuideDorling Kindersley Eyewitness Barcelona and CataloniaCadogan Guides Barcelona (Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls)Time Out BarcelonaAll of them were good. I took two with me: Lonely Planet and Eyewitness.The reasons I chose those two:LP specialises in listings, which seemed to be more up-to-date and comprehensive than either Time Out or Cadogan, It also had a good Excursions section which helped a couple of times when I travelled beyond the city. I also liked a couple of the walking routes they recommended. Information on matters such as public transport is comprehensive and detailed. I like the chapters on history, architecture and food as well.I took Eyewitness because it unfailingly has a good quality map, which in my view is LP's downfall. Eyewitness always includes a Street Finder Index which LP does not, and LP often misses out on streets other than the major ones, which can be very frustrating, especially in a city like Barca where there are many alleyways. I never use Eyewitness for hotels - the information is scant and usually more expensive than my (more Lonely Planet) budget, but it has fantastic colour photos and cutaways of buildings, and illustrations which place buildings within their streetscapes. It's a nice book to read on the bus or train going somewhere.Time Out's great strength was in helping to plan. It had a huge array of hotels, and if you were especially interested in nightlife, I would take Time Out. I was there primarily for a conference, and many of my evenings were organised. And I'm also night a great nightclubber, perhaps contrary to Barca lifestyle!! If you are - consider Time Out. Its maps were pretty good, but not comprehensive for the area I was staying in, beachside Barceloneta.That is where the Cadogan guide excelled.

The first time I read it I was only 11, and to be honest, though I enjoyed IT in general, I didn't understand a lot of it (I was actually looking up the dirty words I didn't understand in the dictionary and wondering why they weren't there!). I was morbidly fascinated and afraid by the horror and the sex scenes; confused by the Derry Interludes. Weirdly enough though, I love the book today at 24 for the same reasons I loved it at 11: IT is a fantastic and intricately layered story with characters that you miss when the book is over, because you've been with them through their whole story as children and adults, best friends. IT leaves you emotional, wanting more, especially of the summer of '58.I'm not sure what I thought about the ending. I agree that perhaps it was a bit anticlimactic. But when I think about it, what else could have been done? I'm not talking about the ""Beverly & the boys"" scene. Even I thought that to be unnecessary and very unbelievable. I was 11 when I first read the book and I found this part extremely weird and shocking. Other than that, I guess the kill had to be anticlimactic; King sort of wrote himself into a corner there. But I forgive the ending for the rest of the book.To those who think that the book needed ""slimming"" a few hundred pages, I don't get it! I believe that every element of the story was essential to build a history of Derry, identifying with the book's characters (there were 7 after all). People don't seem to have any patience anymore. I don't see the book as sloppy. I don't see extra chapters as a ""waste of time"" if they're adding to the book.I didn't want to mention the movie here, I saw it when I was little and it's sort of a kitch classic for my friends and I, and Tim Curry was great. But why did adult Bill have to have that stupid ponytail????? haha."

I had hoped Kolata's book would shed more light on the subject. I was disappointed. Instead of discussing the pandemic itself, I discovered the book was more of a documentary on two scientists competing for a sample of the flu virus - one searcing in Alaska, the other in nether reaches of Norway.To liven the book up, Kolata spends an extraordinary amount of time contrasting the expeditions, which could not be more different in their approach to the subject: one is a lone epidemiologist working on a shoe string budget, the other working with a team of scientists with monied sponsorship. But this is not why I purchased the book. If you are more interested in the story of the disease itself, I recommend Alfred Crosby's America's Forgotten Pandemic.

Longfellow had read a history of Hiawatha and then wrote a grand poem. It surprised me but this poem really is in the stream of Beowolf and Gilgamesh. This poem does not have the passion I found in Beowolf and Gilgamesh, but it reminds me of what it was like to live on this continent before the Europeans arrived, and long afterwards.

That it is, but it is precisely that and other elements that make it remarkable. To truly appreciate Titus one must have read some Roman plays (specifically Seneca's early tragedies) and be relatively well versed in Greek mythology and Roman history. In Titus, Shakespeare gives the audience a great deal of Greek mythology via Ovid's Metamorphoses (compare Lavinia with Philomela and the final &quot;feast&quot; with the infamous dinner that Thyestes had with his brother Atreus). But the play is not only a classic in this sense. It addresses the timeless theme of revenge and the endless cycle of violence begetting violence that ensues as the charachers seek &quot;wreakful vengance&quot; for each horrific deed and pain that one causes the other. There are no heroes in Titus and no &quot;good guys&quot; just raw emotion and passion laid bare. It is at once the worst of humanity recounted with some of the most beautiful poetry that has ever been written."

For that sort of details account and examination, always within a literal Biblical point of view, I would suggest Alcorn's Heaven. This book, another masterfully explored book by Billy Graham, focuses on the here and now in such a way as to examining out outlook toward that day when we die (or even better, thank the Lord, when He comes and Raptures the church). What does it mean in this, now, 21st century to live and to die? What are we to make of the culture of death that we see in the media and across the United States--from the tragedy of the late Ms. Shiavo to abortion on demand and on to euthanasia for our elderly for any old cause or reason? Basically such deaths come about because they are convenient, not based on literal Christian point of view toward the meaning of life and the dignity of dying and death. Graham asks and uses the Bible to answer questions such as ""what does it mean to die as a Christian"" verses ""what does it mean to die without hope"" (i.e. without Jesus Christ in your life as your Savior and King). For those who are dying with Jesus as the Savior, as examined by Graham, there is peace even if the death is in the face of persecution by those who do not see the light. For those who are dying without, well, there is only a slow decline into darkness, as Graham explains using the truth of the Bible. Thus, Mr. Graham is not afraid to ask questions nor is he afraid to look for answers through the written words of the Lord and through those He has touched through the ages to be His messengers, great and small. I would suggest anyone to take this book and seriously read it, examine what it has to say about death, dying, and eternity...work it into reading such books as Deadline and Heaven by Randy Alcorn...and really then falling on your hands and knees for a true talk with the Lord. Here and now you need to understand the eternal truths of living and dying and eternity. Graham points the way for the reader to go on and to use the Bible so that it shows the reader the foundations of truth and of forever."

B000GTC58K,"Crucible, The",,A1T5D35Q310FY3,Iris Chen,0/0,5.0,1200096000,At-the-edge-of-the-seat!,"With its suspenseful plot, melodramatic characters, and excessively strict setting, Arthur Miller's The Crucible expertly captures the helplessness of the wrongfully-accused.The Crucible follows the story of a stubborn cynic in the midst of his society's chaos and paranoia. Not particularly moral, for he had committed adultery, John Proctor is the typical man struggling with his beliefs that are not accepted in his community. His different thoughts violate the society's unsaid policy of conformity, rendering him the perfect character to play out the pitiful hardships of a heretic. Since he neither entirely good nor completely evil, Proctor's character represents the common man, and the average reader can relate to his thoughts about society. Because of this, readers are more able to sympathize with Proctor, drawing the reader more into the book's plot as it goes on. Because of this, the reader eventually faces the same gnawing conflict Proctor faces in the end. While yielding to his society's chaotic witch-hunting disturbs his conscience, holding fast to his beliefs guarantees death. Throughout the play, Proctor battles it out with his pride when he is forced to choose between his life and his conscience. Instead of just a story of trials, The Crucible represents a moral test -is being honest worth dying for? The reader contemplates this inevitable question as he flips faster and faster (and his heart beats faster and faster!) to reveal the fatal end - his ethics win, and Proctor hangs dead.Only by placing his story in a strict community would Miller be able to illustrate the overwhelmingly contagious fear of evil -and he did just that. Prior to the introduction of John Proctor's character, the story begins with a young girl's false accusation of another of witchcraft in Salem, a Puritan settlement. The idea of the Devil's work, witchcraft, in their own pious community vastly alarms its citizens. Immediately, this fear spreads like an uncontrollable wildfire in a million acre forest. With this paranoia and fear leading to chaos, which eventually causes its tragic finale, The Crucible disapproves of the Puritan society's intolerance of dissent, almost mocking its gullibility and piety.Also, characters developed in the play symbolize different aspects of the human nature. Abigail, the girl who initiates these accusations, does so because of her vengeful stubborn nature -a perfect representation of the play's antagonist. Her anger and confusion towards her banishment from Proctor's house motivates her revenge. Goody Proctor, the symbol of moral goodness, is, of course, John Proctor's wife -a daily painful reminder of his past sins. Throughout the play, she reflects a self-less personality, creating a standard for her husband to achieve. These characters help further shape John Proctor's dilemma at the end.As for context, Miller compares these Salem witch-trials depicted in the play to the 1950s Red Scare in the United States. As the witch-trials begin with one accusation, so does the Red Scare. The piety and overwhelming fear in the Devil in the community allows the witch-hunt to continue throughout the Puritan settlement. Paralleling this fear, the paranoia of Communism in the steadfast Democratic-Republican United States allows the trials and accusations to pervade throughout America.As readers, we see the absurdity of these Salem witch-trials. With Miller's amazing suspenseful style, we ourselves feel helpless as well because we cannot intervene with the story. Instead, we could only sit back and watch as the ridiculous fear swells out of control within the community. By being able to relate his protagonist to the reader and recreating this very helplessness in the reader as well, Miller thoroughly explores the desperation of the wrongfully accused. Yet, Miller also comments on the ridiculous period of the Red Scare, when people allowed the accusations to get out of hand. This fantastic, discreet but not imperceptible, parallelism between the Salem witch-trials and the Red Scare period adds a historical flair.The Crucible is an exciting and engaging play, holding suspense until the very satisfying end. Like a Shakespeare play, The Crucible makes a reader fully experience from the initial complications to the final catharsis."

The characters are painted so vividly that you feel as though you have always known them. The plot involves a great scenario set up in with a great degree of credibility. You believe that spy organizations like this exist, and that the Abelard sanctions really exist.David is known for his attention to detail and this book is no exception. The detail of the operations is astounding, he glosses over no part of the spy game he describes with a detail that makes it all seem real. Many authors just have the 'spy' put on a wet suit, dive under the boat with C4 and blow it up. David shows so much detail that it's like you are in the planning meetings and you know all the finer points of the craft.Everyone will enjoy this book. Whomever you are you should give it a shot."
B000P0KFPU,Chuang-Tzu : The Inner Chapters,,A1V359XAMSXP7Y,bryan12603,22/24,5.0,892512000,Excellent!,"This is one of the best translations of the writings attributed to the brilliant Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu. Although less well known outside of China than &quot;Lao Tzu,&quot; the reputed author of the _Tao Te Ching_, Chuang Tzu, who lived in the 4th century B.C., is both one of history's greatest anti-rationalist philosophers and one of the best prose stylist of world literature. Among the most famous (and moving) passages in his eponymous work is the story of how Chuang Tzu (whose full name is Chuang Chou) dreamed he was a butterfly, and, upon awakening, &quot;does not know whether he is Chou who dreams he is a butterfly or a butterfly who dreams he is Chou.&quot;Graham gives a complete translation of the &quot;Inner Chapters,&quot; which are regarded by many scholars as the authentic works of Chuang Tzu, and also gives selections from later Taoist works, attributed to Chuang Tzu (but probably from other philosophers). Graham's interpretive Introduction (with sections on such tasty topics as &quot;Rejection of Logic&quot; and &quot;Death and Mutilation&quot;) is itself one of the classic interpretations of Chuang Tzu's philosophy.Readers familiar with the _Chuang Tzu_ from other translations will notice that Graham has rearranged some sections of the text. This is not mere whim on Graham's part, but part of his thoughtful view that parts of the text have been moved from their original locations due to textual corruption as the book was recopied by generations of scribes.As you can see, this book is currently out of print (which is a testament to both the poor taste of much of the book-buying public, and to the near-sightedness of publishers). I sincerely hope that some publisher will pick up the rights to this outstanding translation.Other excellent translations of the _Chuang Tzu_ include those by Burton Watson, _Chuang Tzu: Basic Writings_, and Victor Mair, _Wandering on the Way_. Two fine collections of interpretive essays on Chuang Tzu's thought are Paul Kjellberg and Philip J. Ivanhoe, eds., _Essays on Skepticism, Relativism, and Ethics in the Zhuangzi_, and Victor Mair, ed., _Experimental Essays on Chuang-tzu_."

Amazingly, most of them are just as appropriate today, in 2003. Sadly, as Maher points out, Americans today aren't exactly as motivated to actually make the sacrifices necessary to win the war.And of course, there's a few laughs to be had--although this book is pretty straightforward, not to be considered the usual fare by say, George Carlin or even Michael Moore. It is not a comedy book, but rather a brilliant step back and examination of where we're REALLY at, post-9/11.Absolutely recommended. The only caveat is that this book is SHORT--all said, it's probably about 60 actual pages (although it's coffee table sized). I finished it in two sittings.

As with all the ""For Dummies"" books, the organization flows easily from one topic to the next, making the book as useful for someone looking for a specific or even random tidbit on the topic, or one looking for a more comprehensive summation of the disease, its treatment, and its outcomes. It covers the basics (symptoms, theories on causes, what it is, comparisons to normal reproductive functioning versus what happens with endo, etc.), and also covers different treatments (mainstream, surgical, drug, and alternative) and what to look for in a doctor. It also helps patients think of what to discuss with the doctor and which questions to ask, which is great, since diagnosis is often delayed 8-15+ years.While it may not go incredibly in depth on any one aspect of endometriosis or get too deep into the scientific nitty gritty, it gives the reader a wide enough breadth of knowledge to lay the groundwork for further research into serious medical texts and studies. It was, of course, detailed enough for most people and didn't leave me with any unanswered questions.

B000NZ53B8,Squiggly Wiggly's Surprise: a Finger Puppet Learns About Colors,,AQKGAXWPHZ1LD,Kate Merrill,7/7,5.0,955929600,Squiggly Wiggly's Appeal To the Child Reader,"Squiggly Wiggly's Surprise by Arnold Shapiro is an interactive book in which the child uses a finger puppet caterpillar to learn about colors. Each page features a hole in the page that the finger puppet comes through to allow Squiggly Wiggly to experience something different on each page. From leaves to flowers, Squiggly Wiggly travels through the seasons and ends up making himself a cocoon in which he becomes a beautiful butterfly. This book teaches colors so that the child will be able to learn them by Squiggly Wiggly sitting on and eating green leaves, sitting on and smelling a red rose, yellow daisy, purple pansy, talking to a blue bird, and admiring the orange orange. The child becomes entranced by the finger puppet and, at the same time, learns what colors to associate with certain things by Squiggly Wiggly's contact with these flowers, fruits, leaves, and animals. The book also teaches a child about the life cycle of a caterpillar through the pictures and the finger puppet's involvement in these pictures. When Squiggly appears in the snow, he becomes very cold, and because it is winter the cold signals hibernation. In the next picture, Squiggly spins a brown sack around himself, after which he is shown inside the black sack, and he grows tired and falls asleep. The next picture shows Squiggly waking up as a butterfly. Using color and these particular pictures enables a child to learn about the stages that a caterpillar goes through before he becomes a beautiful butterfly. I feel that both techniques used to teach color and pictures showing a caterpillar's development process, are both highly effective in teaching child readers. The interactive portion of this book also appeals to children because they can participate in the book as they read it."
B000L69PC2,The Mayor of Casterbridge. The Life and Death of a Man of Character.,,AHXAPVSHPJ6OJ,A.J.,4/4,5.0,1006128000,Simultaneously somber and bright,"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."

There is so much truth, on numerous subjects, revealed in these pages. Some people have searched their whole lives to discover only a fraction of what can be found here. I'm talking about the author's ability to beautifully describe the indescibable. It's a wonderful story on ALL levels.It works as a love story, as a guide to the higher planes and as a texbook on reincarnation. One cannot help but be moved and uplifted by the author's experiences.I have given this book to two people who had terminal cancer. They both said that reading it was the best gift they could have ever received. It gave them a comfort and an acceptance of what was to come that they did not have before. It is a wonderful book for anyone who has ever lost a loved one. It is a book that will satisfy one's own soul about that great unknown....death and the afterlife."

However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."

The personalities don't fit. Entire chapters have been deleted by the translator, and other chapters have been entirely made up by the translator. And, some portions of the text appear to be transliterations, rather than conceptual translations. That renders some portions nearly unreadable.This translation is not a -bad- story, but there are other versions that are FAR better.The most fluid, flowing, and faithful English translation is that of Frederick Amadeus Malleson, titled ""Journey to the Interior of the Earth"" (or ""A Journey Into the Interior of the Earth""). That should be no surprise, considering his translation was published in 1877, alongside the original French version.The Malleson translation is not currently available on Amazon, but can be found by following Amazon's link to archive.org (on Amazon's ""Free eBook Collections"" page)."

Klinger's notes are extremely helpful and informative (not to mention entertaining), and the copious illustrations by Paget are a great addition as well. This (and the other volumes, of which Adventures, Hound of the Baskervilles, and Study in Scarlet have been published to date) are a worthy successor to William Baring-Gould's justly acclaimed annotated Holmes from years back, and are, in opinion, a better value and more enjoyable read than the rather dry Oxford editions.If you are new to Sherlock Holmes, this may not be the most economical way to pick up all of Conan Doyle's work. But if you are a long-time Holmes fan, or just want to experience the Holmes stories in a deeper and more informed way, I can think of no better purchase than this. Very highly recommended!!!"

I did think it was a little &quot;strict&quot; in some areas, like the &quot;best odds&quot; pregnancy diet, but if you are brutally honest with yourself, you have to admit that it is what it is- the diet that gives your baby the &quot;best odds&quot; of being born healthy. It doesn't try to sugar coat issues to make everyone happy. (And it didn't stop me from enjoying fast food a couple times a week, or make me feel guilty about it!) I especially liked the month by month breakdown of what is happening with your baby and your body.

By the end of the story, that obviously wasn't quite the case, but for some odd reason, Davis wishes to continue the story in JUSTICE LEAGUE: ANOTHER NAIL. This time around, the New Gods are at war, demons are attacking the Earth, and characters from almost every period of DC history are in existence at once - in short, the DCU is going wacko. The Justice League, with the help of the Outsiders, the Metal Men, and the Doom Patrol, among others, must solve the mysteries and save the day.Alan Davis' art for this story is absolutely beautiful, and I can't help but feel that he took on this project primarily to have the opportunity to draw as many different and obscure characters as possible, with the story being secondary. While it does get off to a good start, it quickly began to confuse me as it zigged and zagged all over the place. Soooo much happens, but I was hoping that Davis could somehow tie it all together. Well, he really let me down with a conclusion that was too simple for such a huge set-up. The heroes undergo some very interesting changes, and the tension is pretty good, but in the end, I was left wondering what the point of the story was. While there is a ""nail"" of sorts, it is nothing like the focus of the previous book. In short, what I am left with is a book full of pretty pictures and interesting situations, but ultimately, nothing very satisfying."

And for some of the other reviewers who said it was boring, Orwell is a terrible writer, and its not at all realistic... Its not supposed to be realistic, its supposed to be an insight into the human mind. Its not boring if you understand it, if you are too ignorant to get it, then of course its boring, I'm sorry your teacher MADE you read it, I'm sure youll be quite content with Dr. Seuss.

Louis ""Louis""",7/23,2.0,1105228800,An interesting approach to an issue of his own life?,"This story is widely depicted as a story of irrational jealousy and distrust -- that of a married man unreasonably jealous of the attentions of another gentleman's attentions to his wife, and the married man's distrust of his wife's protestations of innocence.It is far more interesting a story if one knows that Trollope, himself, engaged in such a relationship while married, having fallen in love with a woman (considerably his junior)-- a Miss Kate Field, whom he met while visiting his mother. Apparently he visited her in America without his wife, wrote many letters to her, and eventually introduced her to his wife on a subsequent visit.One may speculate, then, that the relationship with Miss Fields, while close, and often written about as one of unconsumated love, may have caused Trollope's own wife to exhibit what he considered to be irrational jealousy and distrust, especially since his marriage vows are said not to have been broken with Miss Fields.It is left, therefore, to the reader, both of his autobiography and of his novels, to determine the more interesting question of whether ""infidelity"" can entail attachments of the spirit as well as those of the flesh, and whether this novel is not a reflection of the novelist's own marital difficulties, and, perhaps, of his attempt to rationalize his own behavior."

B000F33WU2,The Old Man and the Sea,,A20ZZ7CGCQ9FEA,Mark Coddington,1/2,3.0,1072051200,the nobel prize for fishing,"This is a short parable about the food chain. I read an amazonian editorial review which baldly stated that the old man is ""triumphant as the other fishermen marvel at the size of the skeleton."" Perhaps this reviewer read a different book ... there is absolutely no ""triumph"" or any other strain of hubris in the old man's character. Only a strong resolve and bucketloads of humility. The old man is not even around when the fishermen and tourists are ""marvelling"" - he's in his shack, in bed, recuperating. Maybe this reviewer never even read the book. Just up to the bit where it starts to get boring, after the old man actually hooks the fish, and then figured on a good Hollywood ending. Fair enough. Actually reading a book is a hindrance to writing a good review. Check out my only other amazonian review, on ""Recollections of a Bleeding Heart"" and see what I mean. Never even read it. Good review though, don't you think? Sure, no one has yet voted that they found my review helpful. I would be very hurt if anyone did. Bleeding utilitarians. If you want to read something helpful, read the instruction manual for your dvd player or something. Don't waste time reading reviews by mark coddington.But I did actually read Hemingway's novella. Sort of felt obliged. You know, when books start to reproach you each time you glance at them? I've got a 614 page biography of Arthur Miller on the bookshelf in front of me, with Arthur's face on the spine looking at me through those crazy black minimalist glasses (they never really caught on, did they?) and he knows that I'm never going get around to reading ""Timebends"" in this lifetime, and he's staring at me with reproach.Back to the parable. This old guy hasn't caught a fish for yonks. Everyone thinks he's bad luck, except the boy. One day he goes out deep, hooks himself one big effoff fish. Too big to fit in the boat, he straps it alongside and by the time he brings it in, sharks have picked it clean.I mean, there you have it. Its not about spoils going to the victor. Its not about overcoming great challenges against all odds, then rubbing your detractors' noses in it. Just because The Old Man and the Sea is written by an American, doesn't mean it's about winning.The book's 127 pages long. After the old man hooks the fish, he takes 83 pages to bring the creature in. 83 pages of Hemingway's unrelenting and unembellished prose. Think of the most uncomfortable chair you've ever sat on. Now pick a number between one and ten. Imagine sitting on that chair for that many hours. It will start to give you some idea of what reading this book is like, particularly if you are an empathetic type like me. The cuts on the old man's hands from the line - ow! Now, multiply this number of hours by nine. If you get a two-digit number, add those numbers together, otherwise stick with what you got. Now subtract five. Just do it! (Oops, I think I've broken copyright laws. Ignore that last sentence). Next, count along that number of letters in the alphabet and think of a country starting with the letter you came to. Take the second letter of that country's name and think of the first animal that comes into your head. Got it? Now when you've finished reading this review, I'll tell you what animal that was. And I'll bet you right now that you didn't think of a fish or an old man.) Okay, do we have a deal? But I digress. The idea of the animal kingdom provides one key to understanding this tale. Firstly, the old man constantly dreams of lions on the beach in Africa. Why? What do lions represent? I do not profess to be proficient in, or interested in, psychoanalytic approaches to literature. But the lions must represent something important to the old man, or why would Hemingway waste his valuable - sorry, useful - time by writing about it? Secondly, the old man (his name is Santiago, by the way, but is seldom referred to as anything other than ""he"" or ""the old man"", so I'll follow Ernest's lead) continually refers to the fish he has hooked as his ""brother"". During the old man's three day fishing marathon, he eats raw fish, as he has no other sustenance, which further emphasizes this ""brotherhood"". Hemingway is asking, where does man stand in relation to the animal? Then he goes a long way toward answering it: ""I am only better than him though trickery and he meant me no harm."" And: ""But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.""The old man is alone, locked in a battle with both himself and the fish. Yet he identifies with the fish; he feels sorry for it: ""I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish."" The fish's name is Alberto, but is only ever referred to as ""fish"" by Hemingway. In a struggle to come to terms with his own life and imminent death, the old man talks aloud to himself, asking questions both simple and profound. Death is a central motif in ""The Old Man and the Sea"", but not one I'm much interested in.Perhaps looking for motifs, and pondering their significance, is to read too much into a book. Maybe this one is just a story about an old man who catches a big fish. Here's an interesting question. Do Jehovah's Witnesses read all books in their literal sense, or only the Bible? Hmm. Furthermore, are there any good customer reviews of the Bible on Amazon? I'm off to have a look. Oh - before I go, I must keep my part of the deal. Was it an elephant?"

Anne is a sweet young woman who has lost her mother and is living with and trying to take care of a father who has been ill and who has some mental challenges; she has lost almost all of her possessions and the house she is living in is sadly in need of repairs. Anne is attempting to attend to some of those house repairs when Robert Weston, whom she has never met as he is just getting ready to move into the area, startles her and she ends up receiving her first rescue from Weston as he rescues her from a nasty fall. Unfortunately, Anne's father mistakes the closeness between her and Weston and his mind won't accept any excuses for them not to be married...immediately! I won't ruin any more of the surprises; I will say, however, that this book does a good job of illustrating how people's gossip (and how they sometimes believe the worst without evidence) can really hurt an innocent person - and that Christians are not exempt from the pain they can cause by gossiping. Also - God will provide, including someone to love."
B000PGJ45G,Sense & Sensibility,,,,5/6,4.0,1177286400,Do you have Sense or Sensibility?,"Can you imagine a world where there was nothing to do but walk and talk? In the historical fiction novel Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen it proves that a story can be more interesting than what it appears to be. One character represents sense (Elinor) and the other represents sensibility (Marianne). The story which takes place in the early 1800's when two teenage girls who move to the country with their mother and sister to live on their cousin's estate. While there, the two girls enter into several relationships. Some will last and others will not. Marianne meets the ""dashing"" Willoughby and they soon fall in love, but when Willoughby goes to London things take a turn for the worst. ""Old"" Colonel Brandon soon expresses his love for Marianne which complicates things even more. Elinor becomes close with Edward Ferrars (their sister-in law's brother) and eventually makes it clear she has fallen for him, but when Lucy Steel tells Elinor a big secret her feelings are forced to change.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romantic, comical novel. This book is suitable for anyone about 12 and up. Overall, I really enjoyed Sense and Sensibility. I thought that it was a story that was fairly easy to grasp and it taught me a few things about life back in that day. Very few really learn what these people went through. For us, playing piano, playing cards, writing, taking walks, and visiting may not sound that ideal. This is because we are exposed to so many more interesting things, but you learn a lot from seeing the way the girls coped with having a much simpler life. My only complaint about this book was that since it was written so long ago, some of the language is difficult to comprehend. I would rate these book 4 stars out of 5. In conclusion, I think that Sense and Sensibility is a excellent book that has a good storyline and is perfectly enjoyable."

His novel elaborately blames Nicole for Dick's emotional decay. To me, this story line just doesn't bear close scrutiny. Dick's behavior is controlling,habitually deceitful and at times misogynistic. Time after time Dick control's Nicole's actions and refuses to allow her to even discuss her viewpoint. Nicole's behavior is unbalanced but is it schizophrenic?It's very revealing that a 28 year old man would fall in love with a 16 year old girl. Later, when Nicole has grown up a bit, Dick falls in and out of love with Rosemary, a very child-like 18 year old.Granted, women's rights were along way off in 1925 the year Fitzgerald began writing Tender is the Night, but Dick seems more in charge of Nicole's life than seems warranted by either the prevailing culture or by Nicole's illness.I'd say that Fitzgerald unconsciously revealed his own role in his decaying marriage and like most folks tried to point the finger elsewhere."

B000OVHRGU,"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table",,A14638TGYH7GD9,Rebecca Haden,18/18,5.0,1089244800,Convenience for Healthy Eaters,"Around 5:00 at the place where I work, you can hear the women asking each other &quot;So, what's for dinner at your house?&quot; One coworker says she doesn't mind the cooking, but she wishes she didn't have to think up what to eat every day. Another bemoans the fact that her family ends up with take-out food so often. Ely's book can really help with this situation.Each week, you can print out a shopping list from the website associated with this book, write in breakfast and lunch items, and head to the store with confidence. You will be able to come home from work every night and cook a healthy, balanced meal for your family. I live in a rural area, but still have no trouble finding the items on the list.The menus for each week include a soup or salad meal, fish, a crockpot meal (most families nowadays have at least one day a week when they need to eat in a hurry, so this is a plus!), and beef and chicken dishes. The meals rely on seasonally available produce, and cooking methods reflect the seasons -- for example, you don't need to use your oven in the summer. There are only six meals given for each week, so you can pull a family favorite together for the seventh day, or have a meal out. Having used the book for a few months, I have found that the shopping lists leave me with enough extra food to cook for the seventh night. There are no breakfast or dessert suggestions, but the neatly categorized lists print out with space to write the needed items in.The recipes themselves are very good -- if you like vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and spices instead of salt, fat and sugar. If you are concerned about your health, this is the way you should be eating, so it's worth giving it a try. I am not going to pretend that my kids get excited about brussels sprouts, but they are gradually getting accustomed to eating healthy foods, and I appreciate that. The variety of dishes is excellent -- there are homey foods like burgers and elegant dishes like Chicken Pasta with Artichokes. All are quick, easy, and flavorful. I probably wouldn't have bought this book just for the recipes, but I have been surprised by how good these simple dishes taste.I still use my large collection of cookbooks (after all, you only have 6 dinners for each week in this book -- that is not all the cooking required of moms), and occasionally pull a recipe from the internet when I am willing to go to the amount of trouble involved in that. But I love this book, and I think that most family cooks will find that they save time and money by using it, even if dinner doesn't need saving."
0451410238,Chasing Darkness,,AFVQZQ8PW0L,Harriet Klausner,21/22,5.0,1015113600,high voltage thriller,"She was a homicide detective in the Sheriff's department but she became sick of dealing with death all the time so she transferred over to the State of California of Department of Justice working mainly with abuse victims. At the same time she transferred jobs Sam Chase unexpectedly gained guardianship of her twin eight-year-old nephews. Their parents died in a car crash and their deceased mother (Sam's late sister) did not want her family in Mississippi even getting near them.Eight years later Sam and her two nephews Derek and Rob are a family. Sam is a success at work and envied by her peers when one of her old cases comes back to haunt her. The mother of a child abuse victim is found murdered and Sam is forced to work with Derek Thomas of the Sheriff's department since the victim looks like she was murdered by a serial killer that Sam once caught. Since the killer is dead, the police are working on the assumption that it's a copycat killer until another homicide is committed and Sam is linked to both deaths.Danielle Girard is a name to watch because she's rapidly reading the level of a Nancy Taylor Rosenberg or a Sandra Brown. CHASING DARKNESS is a tightly woven thriller that shines a dark light on the evil things done to children and shows how it affects them long after the abuse stops. The strange and off beat romance that develops between Sam and Derek is a realistic necessary subplot to reduce the tension, which becomes unbelievably high voltage at times. This one sitting read entertains as well as educates.Harriet Klausner"

1932100385,"The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health",16.47,A1B8D9NGZT3CVL,"Runner Drummer ""Mark""",26/31,5.0,1174521600,Brings clarity to an important issue...,"I've got to admit I was pretty skeptical at first (having seen a lot of garbage in the guise of nutrition and diet books) but after reading it I've come to the conclusion that this ought to be the fundamental textbook for a PhD-level nutrition science class. (And I've also come to the conclusion that I may need to re-think a few things. I hate it when that happens...)I've been seriously perusing it for the past couple of weeks, and I'm surprised at how thorough the research is, and how intelligently he explains the data and conclusions. About 90% of what he says agrees with my understanding and/or experience regarding these subjects over the past several years. And for the 10% difference... I'm actually willing to concede that he may be right and I may be wrong on some of these.This book is a very good, objective, scientific resource. Finally, someone with unimpeachable credentials & the research to back it up explains the scientific reasons why (for example):Type-2 diabetes is almost entirely self-induced...Atkins is not only full of BS but dangerous and doomed to failure in the long run...Diet has everything to do with the epidemic of heart disease in this country...Diet also has a lot to do with the most prevalent types of Western cancer (colo-rectal, breast, prostate)...Absolute avoidance of the sun may be as bad as too much sun...Genetics has very little to play in many of these diseases - it's about 90/10 environmental factors...And it's not just a bunch of well-intentioned theory. He provides tons of footnotes and backs it all up with huge, multi-year, peer-reviewed studies. Pretty unassailable.(And I was stunned to find out that Doctors only get 20 HOURS of nutrition in med school...? No wonder most of them don't know squat about the subject. Same for exercise science. So here you have the two absolute cornerstone subjects which are far and away the most important topics relating to your health, and they don't study them...???)There were a couple of areas where I'd like to see some more info...The main one is that I'd like to see more experimental differentiation between lean animal protein vs animal fat. It's pretty obvious to anyone who's paying attention that animal fats (specifically non-Omega 3 animal fats) and most saturated fats in general (and all trans-fats) are the kiss of death (preceded by a crappy life in most cases) but the studies showing animal protein intake vs cancer & heart disease rates around the world are likely not showing the whole story. He concedes that they usually run hand-in-hand (populations that eat a lot of animal based protein invariably eat a lot of animal fat) but I'd like to see the effects of a very low fat (and almost NO animal fat) whole-foods based diet, but in which some of the protein comes from lean animal sources. (My interest in this is for selfish reasons, as this pretty much describes my diet, but a lot of other fitness-minded folks follow a similar program, and there's no sense throwing out the chicken with the chicken nuggets...)The other area that needs more emphasis is on the importance of aerobic activity (and strength training) to go along with proper nutrition, as the two are really inseparable. (At its most basic, calories in minus calories out equals weight gain or loss, plus there are a ton of other measurable medical benefits of exercise.) I realize it's primarily a nutrition book and not an exercise book, but the fact that many (most?) people in developing countries are much more physically active than the average American obviously has a serious effect on their vastly lower rate of certain diseases (heart disease being foremost). And Campbell does make this clear in one or two places, but it would be really instructive to see the results of studies where all participants had identical diets but the aerobic activity was varied. (These studies exist - we've all seen them - but it would help paint the whole picture to include them in this book.) Campbell obviously values the medical effects of cardio work - he's 70 and still runs 6 miles a day, and seems to give at least partial credit for his continuing mental agility to the benefits of aerobic exercise. But the overall impression the reader may get is that health/wellness/fitness is perhaps 80/20 diet vs. exercise, when in reality it's probably at least 50/50.But these are minor quibbles in light of the huge amount of scientific clarity this book provides on the overriding impact of diet on almost every aspect of our well-being. And his expose of the whole government/industry/science/academia debacle (based on a lifetime on the inside of all this) is better than anything I've ever seen on the subject. I hate to use this much hyperbole in one review, but this is probably the most important book I've read in the past 10 years. Two thumbs way up."

The only woman to ever outwit Sherlock Holmes (by his own admission), Irene is a force of nature who relies on her wits and intuition to solve cases others have given up on. She also delights in giving Sherlock Holmes a run for his money, and often astonishes the seasoned Consulting Detective with her sharp deductions and ability to stay one step ahead of him.In Irene &amp; Nell, CND has created characters that have depth, intelligence and intuitiveness that captivate the reader. Ms. Douglas' attention to detail is amazing -- Victorian England &amp; France seem to come alive on the pages and immerse the reader in a by-gone world.If you haven't had the pleasure of reading the other Irene Adler books, you're missing out on a fantastic series.

B000865ZGK,The Night Life of the Gods (Armed Services Edition),,A2YX149QZZQ0TN,Caroline Niziol,0/0,4.0,1348617600,Mythology-themed romp,"The 1931 novel The Night Life of the Gods, by Thorne Smith, opens with a bang--literally. Once again, Hunter Hawk, a brilliant and madcap scientist, creates an explosion in his laboratory--continuing his predilection to rattle and annoy his family. Only his niece, Daffy, who loves and admires her uncle, takes an interest in his mysterious experiments, the latest of which permits him to turn flesh into stone. Various high jinx ensure as Hawk indulges his desire to annoy his family and acquaintances by turning various bits of them into stone. Soon, however, Hawk meets Meg, the mischievous daughter of a leprechaun. Meg, although she has been alive for quite some time, has maintained a youthful charm and incurs the wrath of Hawk's family with her scandalous behavior.Meg and Hawk spend some time tormenting their high society acquaintances, but soon turn to a more exciting plan. Though Hawk can turn flesh into stone, Meg can turn stone into flesh: these two scoundrels turn their attention to the ancient statues in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, bringing the title's ""gods"" to life. Uproar and mayhem result, with Neptune terrifying fishmongers and Venus chasing after any men she can find. The gods, along with Hawk and Meg, consume prodigious amounts of cocktails; though this is Prohibition-era New York City, they manage to exist in two states: intoxicated and hungover.Smith's prose has the effervescent quality of Dorothy Sayers's mystery novels, with a similar emphasis on dry wit and contemporary colloquialisms--but Smith's protagonists are thoroughly American, even the ancient gods themselves.Occasionally, the text of the novel takes on a slightly pretentious, overly-arch tone that makes readers feel like they are on the outside of an inside joke. Though Smith can be quite funny, the times of feeling excluded from the prose prevents full investment in the events of the story.For readers looking for a light, airy novel, The Night Life of the Gods will fit the bill. Its manic humor and shenanigans will please any fan of 1930s fiction."

In this book, which seems to have been written in reaction to a speech given by a priest in Nigeria, the author attempts to lay out a &quot;magnum opus contre gentiles&quot;. What he actually accomplishes is something quite less than that. He begins the work in the most promising of ways: laying out the fundamental &quot;creeds&quot; that differ between Islam and Christianity - the theories of atonement, crucifixion of Jesus, and deity of Christ.Throughout, the arguments are as shallow as they are poor. The author seems not to have ever considered how it might be that Christian scholars, who are well-aware of the verses he cites, have traditionally understood them. For example, he takes the passage from Deutoronomy indicating that those crucified are cursed as being evidence that Jesus could not have been crucified because, after all, Jesus was a good guy, and good guys are not cursed. Furthermore, sweeping and unfounded generalizations are littered throughout the text &quot;Christianity has no plan for how we are to live in this world&quot; (p.146), and so many others that it is pointless to mention them here. In the end, his final argument of the book, the one that he always tacitly returns to, is &quot;In this respect, Christianity differs from Islam, and therefore says what is false&quot;.What Islam needs, and what I am presently looking for, is serious apologetic scholarship. When I find it, I'll let you know.

Every chapter offers added insight featuring biographies on people that may have had influence on the subject being written about that adds more intrigue to this book. This book is very comprehensive and fair to all parties involved often bringing to light the importance of doctors and nurses through out the entire war and it's aftermath.

They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder!

0804118272,Bequest,,A3LEH416AV3VTU,Regan,0/0,5.0,1316476800,Unusual Western Historical Romance,"Set in Central City, Colorado in 1874, this story of the post Civil War west makes for a most interesting romance. Proctor writes exceptionally well and the story will definitely hold your attention. There is lots of action, mystery and a love that will tear at your heart. If you've ever love a man who couldn't return your love because of his haunted past, this one's for you.Gabrielle Antoine has been raised in a New Orleans convent, believing she is an orphan. Her dream is to one day have a school for girls. Then one day, as a young woman, she finds out her mother only recently died and has left her a house and a business in Colorado. Gabrielle is most curious and decides to go there to learn more about her mother. It turns out the house and business are the same--a brothel--and her mother was the madam who, while still a beautiful woman at 40, was murdered. Once in Colorado, Gabrielle meets her mother's business partner, a tough ex-Confederate officer and former Texas Ranger named Jordan Hays, whose brothers died in the war and whose pregnant wife was raped and murdered by Union soldiers. He is one cold guy, but he can also be charming and he charms Gabrielle. An innocent virgin, Jordan tells her he will take her innocence and leave her with less than she had when he leaves as he intends to do. He has no desire to marry again. He thinks it will be easy to take her and ruin her. It is and he does. Gee, what a good guy (not!). Gabrielle's one fear is becoming like her mother...and it seems Jordan is willing to help her down that path. Then comes a bad guy who wants the brothel to add to his kingdom, and he doesn't care who he has to corrupt or murder to get it.There are wonderful secondary characters, the prostitutes in the bordello, their children and the villains (and there are more than one!). As Gabrielle develops a heart for the women and their children, so will you. We are all a product of our pasts and these women had very difficult pasts.Though Proctor lives in Australia, she writes about Colorado as if she had been a long time resident. Her descriptions of the natural beauty of the place are quite accurate and well done. She is a master storyteller. Suddenly, you are back in the west of the 19th century when people were trying to carve a life for themselves out of the rugged terrain and difficult circumstances.I recommend this one!"
B000PXWA1O,God of Small Things 1ST Edition Us,,,,18/18,5.0,1012521600,"Resoundingly powerful, deeply moving","Before saying anything about this book - my literary tastes. I like simple books - feel-good books with a quick-moving plot, linear narrative, simple prose and above all, an authorial voice that stays in the background.Why then do I love this book?It is the living embodiment of everything I dislike in a novel - the authorial voice is so loud you couldn't miss it if you were deaf; the narrative is anything but linear and the prose is everything but simple; the symbolism is everything but subtle; the pace is everything but fast. There are no simple solutions, no happy resolutions - this is the sort of book that makes you wish you had never lived.The story is enormously complex - a lesser writer would have cracked under the burden of the plot, but not this one. The story traces the history of the Indian state of Kerala. I have no idea how accurately she has portrayed its history - but it must be said that every page of the book bears that 'stamp of authenticity' so essential for a book of this kind.The greatest triumph of this book - apart from the brilliant characterization and the hugely complex and demanding plot - is the language. I am not talking about the 'poetic prose' that covers the pages of this book - I refer to the convincing manner in which she conveys the flavour of 'Indian English.' Few writers manage to describe how Indians really talk without descending to the exotic or worse, the ludicruous - a few manage to pull it off. R. K Narayan was one. Arundhati Roy is another.Instances of 'Indian English' abound.There is Rahel telling her twin brother that 'sorry doesn't make a dead man alive' - I am not entirely sure she did not eavesdrop on my private conversations. Then there is Estha saying 'Thang God' on finding out that the elephant that has died isn't an elephant they know, and Baby Kochchamma's subsequent correction - all priceless, and wickedly accurate.Then there is the plot - conceived on an epic scale - at first, it seems to want to say everything without actually saying anything. Then the pages on the right grow thin and you find that everything makes sense - the whole, complex, convoluted story, every 'Small Thing' now finds a place in the scheme of things.Each character is perfectly drawn out - fully three-dimensional. You have the Oxford-educated Chacko, the ornamental-gardening-graduate-cable-TV-addict-untouchable-hating ...-Father-Mulligan-loving Baby Kochamma (in my opinion the book's most convincing character), Papachi - the anglophile and the violin playing Mamachi - all perfect. And what is one to say of the portrayal of the twins. I am yet to find a book that can write of children's feelings more convincingly. 'Convincing' is the keyword here.That there will be those who may dislike her political views, there is no doubt (I have an exceedingly low opinion of her political essays), but the manner in which she delivers a resoundingly powerful, deeply moving tale - what can I say - whoever coined the word 'masterpiece' must have had had this book in mind."

I don't think it is right to judge a book on the basis of what I wanted it to be, rather than what it actually is, but I thought I would start by stating my bias up front.What the book is: kind of a coffee-table travel book of India, full of beautiful photos and descriptive text about many parts of India and its cuisines, along with complete recipes with authentic ingredients, often stating the regions from which the recipes came. It is large and heavy as cookbooks go, making it a bit unwieldy for use in the kitchen or for carrying around for grocery shopping.It is organized by type of recipe - salads, rice, breads, vegetables, dals, fish and shellfish, chicken and eggs, lamb beef and pork, street foods snacks and drinks, sweets, etc - not by region. At first this put me off, because the subcontinent would seem to be treated as one cuisine, which it most certainly is not.Ah, but then I noticed that not only do most recipes describe the region the recipe came from and sometimes a bit about what makes that special, but the index actually has many of the regions called out and lists the page numbers for recipes for that region. This means that if, for example, one wants to study Keralan cuisine, or put on a meal of Keralan dishes, it is quite straightforward to do so.BOTTOM LINEReviews are subjective, and I can only give a rating based on my own purposes and needs, which in this case is four stars: ""I Like It"". I do not love it (five stars) because it is too big and unwieldy. I might also love it if it was organized by regional cuisine. Still, there are many great and useful recipes here for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians - though vegans should be aware that the common use of ghee (clarified butter) and yogurt makes most a lot of Indian food inaccessible to their requirements."

However, as I read more and more, I grew tired of fate's relentless assault on the Joad family.The book contains oodles of sex imagery, to the point I worry about Steinbeck's sanity while he wrote the book. An example of imagery run wild is given in chapter 5, where tractors and farm equipment are described as &quot;raping the ground methodically&quot; and many other sexual references. It's a TRACTOR for God's sake!!!! Continually Steinbeck dwells on sex whenever he can draw a metaphor.Another problem I have with the book is the constant bad luck of the Joad family. Murphy's law is proved countless times as every possiblility of good fortune is systematically destroyed. I believe if the book were three chapters longer, there would be no surviving Joads to write about.In short, while I agree the plot is rather solid, the book is a depressing saga of a family's misfortune in a time when countless other families were experiencing hardships. I recognize the historical importance and the statement this novel makes, but if I had had the choice I would not have read this book. It took me a week to get over the depression and disgust of the human race that The Grapes Of Wrath instilled in me."

Ellsworth Jaeger's book ""Wildwood Wisdom"" fairly oozed woodlore and old time knowledge of the outdoors. He spoke with knowledge borne of experience and of a lifetime in the outdoors, and especially in the north woods. This book shows and tells of many of the old time skills that outdoorsmen lived by, long before the invention of gore-tex, polypro, titanium cookware, and gps. This book probably influenced me as much as any other book I had ever read to become involved with the woods, nature, and the outdoors. If I had to pick only five books that I could take with me to live on a desert island, this would be one of them. I look at it to this day. You cannot read it without wanting to learn more about the old ways of doing things, and many of the topics written about are still relevant to this day.

Jonas and Gabriel are two of the most lovable characters and every reader is sure to fall in love with them. This book is one of those books that can be read over and over again and each time the reader can get something new and different out of it.

Since I'm not used to reading classics during that time, it took me ages before I get the hang of the story and eventually finish it. Nevertheless, I was able to appreciate the story and it instantly became my favorite. Well, who would not fall in love with the story of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy?Three years later, this book was chosen as the featured book for the October face-to-face discussion of my book club and so I decided to read it again since I wasn't able to retain most of the details of the story in my memory. It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations."

Lansdale: is there anything this guy can't do well? My first encounter with him was THE DRIVE IN, a science fiction horror novel. This was followed by THE MAGIC WAGON --- a gothic western if you will --- and COLD IN JULY, a mystery. Then came the Batman-based CAPTURED BY THE ENGINES, TARZAN'S LOST ADVENTURE, the Jonah Hex comic book story arcs, and on and on and on...and they are all great. So with A FINE DARK LINE, we have a coming of age novel set in rural Texas in the 1950s, a time both better and worse than our own and inexorably linked to it. And, like all his other works that have preceded it, A FINE DARK LINE is his finest work to date.A FINE DARK LINE is told through the eyes of Stanley Mitchell, a thirteen year-old boy standing on the summer cusp of adolescence, the younger of two children in a family that isn't poverty-stricken but not exactly next door neighbors to Scrooge McDuck, either. No, the Mitchells are the owners and proprietors of the only drive-in theater in Dewmont, Texas. Stanley's youth and innocence are consumed in a slow-burning maelstrom sparked by his discovery of a tin box containing a collection of troubled love letters that ultimately lead him to a burned out house, the mysterious deaths of two young women and secrets that the powers that be in Dewmont would prefer to stay buried. Stanley's unlikely ally is Buster Smith, the projectionist at the theater, an elderly black man whose attempts to drown his demons in alcohol are doomed to failure but who has a depth that only Stanley is aware of. In attempting to solve the mysteries of the deaths of the two women, Stanley exposes not only himself, but also his family and friends, to danger. A FINE DARK LINE, however, is more than a mystery story. It is, ultimately, the tale of a time not so long gone but vanished completely nonetheless. Lansdale uses the mystery as a vehicle to explore the cultural landscape, race relations and sexual mores of the 1950s. What is most remarkable here is that Lansdale is able to capture so perfectly the voice of a 13 year-old boy in that era. I suspect that, to at least some extent, it is his own, some 50 years removed. If so, it resonates within him pitch-perfectly and his translation is unerring.With A FINE DARK LINE, Lansdale continues to expand the breadth and scope of his literary vision. One could easily come to the conclusion that his talent and landscape know no boundaries. He is a writer who has exceeded the promise of his earliest work and the expectations of his readers --- and will undoubtedly continue to do so.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"

From collecting dead cats and brass door knobs, to trying to impress his crush in Sunday school, Tom Sawyer is always good for an adventure. He lives with his aunt Polly and his half brother Sid, but his orphanhood doesn't stop him from causing trouble.Whether it be faking his own death or being the only witness to a murder along the course of this book, Tom finds his way into different sorts of adventurous mishaps. Throughout the novel Tom matures and experiences many rites of passage. It is fitting that his final step to being a man would have him looking death straight in the eye.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a very smooth read. With every turn of the page there is mystery, suspense, and humor. Twain does a marvelous job of keeping the reader interested in the story. His biggest accomplishment in writing this book is to create an appeal to all audiences, and he did it beautifully. This novel should be recommended to anyone who has never experienced The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."

4789011623,Genki 1: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese 1 (Genki 1 Series) (Japanese Edition),,A34NOE1V5FK2EE,"Ho Tak Chan ""WhiteOkiron""",25/27,5.0,1104624000,Best Japanese textbook i've seen so far,"For those of you who didn't have the chance to browse from a selection of Japanese language book, let me recommend this textbook to you.There is a total of 24 lessons in Genki I & II. Genki I consist of 12 lessons.Here's the sequence to which the lessons are structured1. Dialogue2. English translated dialogue3. Vocabulary4. Grammar5. PracticeWhat I've found best about this textbook compared to other japanese textbook is in the organization. I sometimes stare at ""Japanese for Busy People II"" and get overwhelmed by the difficulty and the globs of unspaced words. It in turn become very discouraging to continue reading because it is not the vocabulary or the grammar that you'd be focusing on, it's finding what's important in that glob of paragraph that takes away your concentration.Grammar:(average of 6 grammar per lesson)In ""An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese"", important grammars are bolded, spaced, and highlighted. The explaination in how to use the grammar are precise and neatly spaced along with an example or two to illustrate how to use it.Vocabulary:(Average of 50 words per lesson)The vocabularies they teach in this textbook are basically the same as the ones in other textbooks. Useful in everyday conversation. But again I must stress that this textbook organized very efficiently.1. Noun2. i-adjective3. na-adjective4. u-verb5. ru-verb6. adverbsFor a beginner, you might not know the reason to distinguish between i-adj and na-adj. But it becomes very useful when you start studying grammar. Some textbooks out there also distinguishes the types of verb and adjectives, but some doesn't.Practices:(6-7 pages per lesson)The practices in this textbook uses both pictures and words to test your recall ability. From the looks of the practices in all the japanese textbooks, they are not designed to be a self-study course. There is no accompanying answer-key along with the practices. I agree that the practice is designed so that you can figure it out by rereading the lesson, but personally, it bothers me because you cannot be sure at that moment whether your answer is correct or incorrect. In a way, it prevents me from putting it into my long term memory because my answers might be wrong. I'm sure my opinion can be argued.Lastly, there is also a Genki Workbook (sold separately). Each lesson has around 8 pages of extra sheets to practice. Again, it has no answer key. The last page in every lesson is a listening assignment. Which means unless you have the CD (not provided within workbook), you cannot do that assignment. But it's still good if you want the extra 7 pages/lesson of practice in writing.A little story to end this reviewA boy went into a language bookstore and asks the store owner which japanese textbook is the best. The store owner replied: ""Genki"" - The EndI know, it's an awesome story."
1401201911,Superman: Red Son,11.42,AHCLBBOSQF7DV,Ross Beaudette,1/1,4.0,1305590400,One of my favorite Elseworld stories,"Superman: Red Son is a simple story that all starts with a ""What If"". What if Superman had landed in Soviet Russia instead of Smallville? From that one question Mark Millar weaves an incredible alternative history where Superman ultimately becomes a supreme world leader.Many other well known characters appear as well, including a freedom fighting Batman that I would love to see more of. However it is of course Lex Luthor that is Superman's main nemesis as he devotes his life and neglects his wife, Lois Lane, to defeat Superman. Luthor's obsession with Superman is perfectly in character while remaining unique to an Elseworld, since his motives are somewhat pure.Ultimately Superman shows that whether raised in America or Russia he is good at heart and would prefer to help people instead of ruling them. The ending drags on a little, but since it is a one-off Elseworld I understand tying up every loose end. I gave this 4 stars since I think it could be a little better with such a rich premise, but I would still recommend this to anyone. If you love Superman, Elseworlds in general, or are just a fan of alternative histories, you should definitely read this."

0375758585,The World at Night: A Novel,10.2,,,6/9,2.0,834710400,Superb evocation of Paris at the eve of World War II.,"I've read all of Alan Furst's books at least three times, except for &quot;World at Night&quot; (which has been out only long enough for one pass).&quot;World at Night&quot; is the fourth of Furst's novels set in Europe before and during World War II. Furst lived in Europe the last few years, reading obscure tracts, diaries, and memoirs of Europeans who survived the war -- spies, peddlers, minor diplomats, -- whomever.The remarkable tone captured in these novels is the result. &quot;Night Soldiers&quot; accompanied me to Spain, and should be read by anyone who wants an additional sense of the Spanish Civil War beyond &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Homage to Catalonia.&quot; &quot;World at Night&quot; has the weakest ending of the four World War II books, in my opinion, but it is still superb. It is reminiscent of ReMarque's novels set in pre-war Paris. I liked Furst's early books, too -- &quot;Your Day in the Barrel&quot; and its sequel (which for some reason Amazon does not list). A warning, however -- these early books are REALLY different from the latter ones, so appreciation of the World War II novels is no guarantee that you'll like these others. If you liked Donald Westlake's early comic/suspense novels like &quot;Fugitive Pigeon,&quot; then you'll like the early Fursts."

B000OW4E7O,Separate Peace,,A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ,"Daniel Murphy ""Dan Murphy""",13/15,5.0,1263945600,A Line Runs Through the Human Heart,"Walking down the aisles of a bookstore or a library and encountering a book called A Separate Peace, flipping open the cover and noting that the copyright is dated 1959, it would not be much of an intuitive leap for the reader to guess that the subject matter involved war. The reader would be right, though he or she could not possibly intuit the richly layered tale that unfolds as pages turn, one by one, between the front and the back cover.Set in an all male and very exclusive high school academy (Devon), this boarding school drama takes place in late 1942 and early 1943. Though populated with a rich assortment of characters, the book revolves predominantly around only two, Gene and Phineas (Finny). Attending a summer session at Devon, Gene and Finny form the Super Suicide Society of the Summer Session, and the two charter members seal their friendship by leaping from a tree into a river. The tree, the origin of the cornerstone event that anchors the novel, is ""tremendous, an irate steely black steeple beside the river."" In this tree, while attempting the dangerous leap into deep water on two separate occasions, both Gene and Finny will lose their balance. In one instance, a steady hand shoots out to save the other friend. In the other, no hand is forthcoming, and the friend plunges downward towards an injury that will permanently alter the life course of both boys. This fall is the polar axis upon which John Knowles, author of one of the most unusual of all books written about wars, be they personal or political, allows his tale to revolve.Only distantly related to the genre of anti-war books, A Separate Peace does not have the gritty and blasted geography of trench warfare in All Quiet on the Western Front, the brilliant cynicism and satire of Catch-22, or the surrealistic and all TOO realistic horror of Slaughterhouse-Five. Knowles' approach to human on human violence, be it two individuals in combat or millions against millions, is subtle, almost understated. After listening to two of his friends debate about the causes of WW II, Gene dissents: ""Because it seems clear that wars were not made by generations and their special stupidities, but that wars were made instead by something ignorant in the human heart."" Why might Gene's statement be important? Because it disallows us the convenience of separating people that fight wars into good folk and evil monsters. Alexander Solzhenitsyn chimes in here ""If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?""Knowles, a winner of the Penn/Faulkner Award, was a brilliant observer of human nature. It is somewhat eerie to see the close correlation of his observations with cutting edge 21st century advances in the nature of human memory and the biological roots of aggressive human behavior (including war). Recent research has made it compellingly clear that we humans are able to freely construct memories that are more consistent with the personal narratives that we want to tell ourselves than they are with accurate depiction of past events. In the recently publishedSex and War: How Biology Explains Warfare and Terrorism and Offers a Path to a Safer World, Potts and Hayden discuss the research that shows that our primate roots have left ""something ignorant in the human heart"", something uniquely male in nature. John Knowles, through simple observation, beat Potts and Hayden to the punch by a half century.Several brief thoughts, if you are considering reading this book. This is a book about men, and the few women that appear are almost ghost-like. Though written more than fifty years ago, the level of craftsmanship and wordsmithing in A Separate Piece has not been surpassed in the 21st century. Although the story is engaging, connoisseurs of prose will find it much more to their liking than will aficionados of action novels. Historical fiction buffs will get a kick both from the powerfully nostalgic description of war-time America and from the fact that characters in the book are reportedly modeled on well known people, e.g. Gore Vidal (one of Knowles' classmates in real life) claims that he was the model for the Devon upperclassman Brinker. Not a page turner, but deeply evocative for those with the leisure to let the ebb and flow of Knowles' prose wash gently over them, A Separate Piece has become defined as a classic. This reader agrees wholeheartedly with that designation."
B000I1VJLA,The Lord of the Rings Box Set,,A1I363TS2KYAT2,Travis Miller,1/2,5.0,1008547200,Everyone must read these books at least once,"Look, it's quite simple. If you haven't read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, something's wrong with you. If you think this is a children's book, you're mistaken. If you think it's just another dime-a-dozen pulp fantasy novel for Dungeons &amp; Dragons geeks, think again. This is a classic of English literature.Tolkien's world is so mind-bogglingly deep, rich, and vast that when you reach the end of the book, you might be startled to find yourself back in the &quot;real&quot; world. Tolkien's genius just sucks you in; his prose is utterly convincing. The characters become a part of you. His portrait of Middle Earth is one of the most vivid and lifelike ever put on paper.The language is sometimes dense, but it's so rewarding that it never feels difficult. The first time I read the books I think I completed each one in a single sitting.This is a book for everyone. It truly is mythic: there are the archetypes of Paradise, destiny and free will, Armageddon, the crusade of good against evil, and Man's place in the cosmos. You'll find yourself reading it time and time again. Invest in the hardcover edition, and pass it on to your grandkids."

I have noticed that the end of Burke's books is not consistent with the books themselves. He does not &quot;build&quot; to the ending, and therefore, the ending is a disappointment.The main character in the book is a person called &quot;Legion&quot;. He is 74 years old, but he gives Dave Robicheaux a fierce whipping and he shames him. Legion is one eerie character and Dave, surprisingly, is scared of him.Two women are murdered (one after the other) and the primarysuspect is Tee Bobby Hulin, described as a &quot;twenty-five year old black hustler...&quot; One of the murdered women is the daughter of a &quot;button&quot; man, Joe Zeroski, who comes to town with the murderous rage. Joe brings his gang to town, including his niece who has an relationship with Clete Purcell. Clete, in the meantime, has an affair with the woman who is Assistant District Attorney. Robicheaux, with the help of a partner, solves the mystery - but he cannot get Legion out of his mind.James Lee Burke is a reflective person. His characters are often violent - but they show a surprising gentleness. I always enjoy Burke's books because they show me a side to him that I had not known."

The writing is beautiful, thoughtful and most importantly action-packed. The characters face surreal problems, such as enormous government conspiracies, and also with issues we each must face in our lives, such as feeling inadequate, or the complex relationships we have with our friends, or having to make the choice between doing what is right and what is easy. It also makes us question our own society and the emphasis put on beauty and fame, our unsustainable lifestyles, and the hidden price of living in a sheltered 1st world society.In particular, I love this book best out of the entire series, because of the way that it begins: Tally isn't out to upset the status quo. She isn't trying to rebel against the system. She just wants to be with her friends, to be older and able to have more and do more. Slowly and believably, she starts to realize that there might be bigger concerns, some of which are worth fighting and sacrificing for. She learns what a true friend is. She learns how unimportant physical appearance is in comparison to creativity, critical thought, and deep emotion. She grows so believably from a typical (if a bit mischievous) teenager into someone determined to change the world, from someone who is mostly self-centered to someone who is mostly self-sacrificing.The series as a whole give us the full scope of the dystopia society so closely based on the ideals of our own. I recommend reading them all. But for those who really seek a character-driven story, this first book gives us a heroine and a coming-of-age story not to be forgotten."

Yet that is exactly what this so-called dictionary attempts to do; promote ignorance and slanderous lies (when it's not simply providing partial truths).The authors clearly did NOT research the occult or much about the other religious groups they write about. Not only do they repeatedly credit Satanism for beliefs completely unrelated to that Sect, but they mutilate any respectable definition of the peace sign -- calling it the ""Satanists Pentacle"" (when penta is the prefix meaning ""five"" and there are no five points inside a peace sign).Regarding the Wiccan Rede -- the authors erroneously attribute it to Aleister Crowley who had NOTHING to do with either Wicca or with the Rede, as an ethical principle that's regularly drummed around many neo-pagan circles. Many would argue Crowley had nothing to do with ethics at all. In fact, he purported ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole law"" (feel like having sex with your neighbor's infant? Do it!) while the Wiccan Rede states ""An it harm none, do what ye will."" The authors also falsely claim that Satanists follow the Rede, when they are not at all compelled by Wiccan dogma, but (according to the Satanist Bible) follow their own rules to do whatever's the OPPOSITE of Christianity.The two examples, provided above, are but the tip of the iceberg for how inaccurate is this dictionary.

B0008AUI1S,Caddie Woodlawn,,A3EDZCHN6IK23Z,Featherhead,3/3,4.0,1280707200,charming recreation of 19c rural Wisconsin,"The author's hymn of praise to her grandmother, in the tradition of the Little House on the Prairie books. Brink tells the story of her grandmother's idyllic childhood in 19th-century rural Wisconsin around the time of the Civil War. She pieced the story together from family memories, and the novel retains this patchwork feel. But a central thread concerning Caddie's tomboyish ways ties the lot together well, and the story has a satisfying resolution. The author herself was orphaned at age eight and raised by her grandmother, so she had plenty of time to absorb the stories.Caddie's rural community lives in uneasy d&eacute;tente with an Indian tribe. Their only connection with civilization is a lumber company steamer that comes up the Mississippi several times a year; the steamer brings them the news of General Lee's surrender and subsequent assassination of Lincoln. Caddie (real name = Caroline) runs wild and free with her older brothers despite her mother's misgivings. Long ago, when Caddie was a baby, her father made an unusual request of his wife: give him charge of the girl. So while her younger sisters stay tidy at home learning feminine skills from Mother, Caddie learns her father's trade (mending clocks) and how to do farm chores. She spends most of her time outdoors, and by age 12 is ruddy and energetic, though rather ill-mannered.One of the nearby Indians speaks some English, and Caddie befriends him. I must point out that the author's grasp of how Native Americans were forced to communicate is rather tenuous. For example, when Caddie expresses affection for Indian John's dog, he says, ""You like him dog."" It is highly unlikely that a pidgin English speaker such as Indian John would have used the objective case of the pronoun. Non-native speakers master the objective case late in the game; Indian John should more correctly have been made to say, ""You like dog."" In other words, a simple subject-verb-object syntax makes more sense. But I quibble.The book is strewn with moral lessons that echo years of hindsight. In one scene, people slaughter passenger pigeons by the thousands, and the narrator says, ""The pigeons, like the Indians, were fighting a losing battle with the white man."" On the whole, the book is like a moving photo album, and one can almost hear the author's grandmother saying things like, ""Did I ever tell you about the time when my Uncle Edmund played a trick on me with the wooden raft? Well..."" It's clear the author is trying hard to be faithful to the details of her grandmother's memories; she explains in the preface that her grandmother reviewed the text for accuracy before it was published. Perhaps a better story would have resulted if the author felt freer to invent.The book's imagery creates a strong impression. The Woodlawn children carry ""foaming buckets of freshly drawn milk,"" and some poor, half-caste Indian children bring ""buckets of parched corn"" to school for their lunch. Some details, apparently clear even by 1935, need an explanatory footnote (""There's a young man in the back sprouting potatoes""). Readers of Johanna Spyri's Heidi (1880) would enjoy this book, both for the imagery and the message. Near the end, Caddie's father does a wonderful thing for her. He tells her that being a woman and practicing the traditional womanly arts takes as much ""nerve and courage"" as men need to ""build bridges and roads in the wilderness."" By doing so, he allows her to choose with dignity intact her inevitable future as a wife and mother.Illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman."
0312322348,The Philosopher at the End of the Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films,,A1W3WE0U2JD4LJ,"James E. Mahon ""Caligula""",10/10,4.0,1101081600,A New Genre: Sci-Phi,"Let me begin by saying that I met the author, Mark Rowlands, on several occasions while he was teaching at University College, Cork, in Ireland. Let me also say that I was extremely jealous when I first came across this book in a bookshop in Cambridge, England. For years I have shown my students clips from science-fiction films such as ""The Matrix"" (re: Descartes's first Meditation) and ""The Terminator"" (re: machines without sensation -- Descartes again) and ""Total Recall"" (re: Descartes's first Meditation again, and Locke's memory theory of identity) when teaching my Modern Philosophy course. But Rowlands beat the rest of us to it and wrote a book in this vein -- an introduction to philosophy by way of popular science-fiction films.This Winter Term (2005), for the second year in a row, I will be assigning this book for my Modern Philosophy course. (Last time I had to order the books from England; this time they are available in the US). In 2004 my students enjoyed the book tremendously and it proved very useful, especially the sections on Descartes (chapters 2 and 3 on skepticism about the external world and the mind-body problem -- ""The Matrix"" and ""The Terminator""), Locke (chapter 4 on personal identity -- ""Total Recall"" and ""The Sixth Day"") and Hume (chapter 5 on free will -- ""Minority Report"").The author, Rowlands, is known best for his work in the philosophy of mind and applied ethics (especially the ethical status of animals). I believe that the earlier parts of the book, dealing with philosophy of mind, metaphysics and epistemology, are easily the best. The final parts of the book dealing with ethics -- chapter 6 on ""Hollow Man"" (why should we be ethical?), chapter 7 on ""Independence Day"" and ""Aliens"" (should the scope of ethics extend to aliens?) and chapter 8 on ""Star Wars"" (good vs. evil) -- are not quite up to standard. Somewhere in between, standard-wise, are the parts dealing with the meaning of life -- chapter 1 on ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" and chapter 9 on ""Blade Runner"".The book is written primarily for undergraduates. It normally does a nice job of presenting philosophical ideas and problems in an appealing and direct fashion. You can tell that the author is part of the generation that grew up watching Star Wars and then Buffy, but has a D.Phil from Oxford and can write about supervenience or Doug Lenat's CYC project.This makes it all sound far too serious and educational, however. The most important thing about this book is that it is funny. It's funny about philosophy, and it's funny about films too. Exhibit A: """"Minority Report""... also has Tom Cruise in it, not a man you normally associate with complex philosophical issues. I mean, scientology? Give me a break."" (p. 121) Rowlands is nothing if not irreverent, and you will laugh out loud while reading this.So far, I have found only a few factual errors (references are to the English Ebury Press 2003 paperback edition). Heidegger's ""Being and Time"" was published in 1927, not 1926 (p. 7). Wittgenstein's ""Tractatus Logico-philosophicus"" was completed in 1918 and published in 1921, not published in 1916 (p. 53). And the Cameron Crowe movie starring Tom Cruise is ""Vanilla Sky"", not ""Vanilla Skies"" (p. 121). The only philosophical error I have found is that he refers to Occasionalism as ""parallelism"" (p. 72) (parallelism is a different position and can be espoused by a Dual Aspect theorist such as Spinoza). But that is just something discussed in a footnote.I am usually not happy with Rowlands' quick resolutions of various matters in the final sections of his chapters. But it would be unfair to beat him over the head about this. I also find some of the humor to be too laddish for my taste. It's not particularly funny to say how much you love beer and imagined sex with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and it becomes painful to say it the n-th time. But these are minor criticims of a refreshing read, on the whole."

999751811X,Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog),,AW97LPKXQUJIF,FictionFan,4/4,5.0,1317081600,Funniest book ever written....?,"To journey up the River Thames in the company of J, George, Harris and, of course, Montmorency the fox-terrier is as good as having a holiday yourself.From first to last this book is packed full of anecdotes, each more joyous than the last. But, while I do think it's the funniest book ever written, there's more to it than that. Written as a travelogue, Jerome tells us lots of interesting historical snippets about the little towns and hamlets along the Thames. And since the book was published in 1889 we get a second historical view of Jerome's own time - a view for once not of the upper-classes or of the poor, but of the ordinary working people in the middle and how they enjoyed their leisure time. One of the things that always surprises me about the book is that the interactions between the three men is so little different to what it would be today and the stories have a timeless quality to them.As well as the humour, Jerome gives poetic descriptions of nature in all its glory and sometimes drifts off into historical imaginings. I know some people find these passages overly sentimental but I love them. They seem quintessentially Victorian to me and they are beautifully written, even when at their most over-blown. This book inspired me to travel up the Thames myself (in a car!) and visit some of the little places that still retain their individuality today despite many of them having been absorbed into Greater London.I sampled several Kindle versions before choosing this oneThree Men in a Boat (Illustrated Edition). It was, as far as I could see, the best formatted and also the only one I could find with illustrations. The illustrations take the form of pencil sketches and are very well done - they add a lot to the overall enjoyment of the book for me. You can, as usual with Kindle illustrations, zoom in on them - useful for the smaller ones.If you've never read this book, give it a try. If you've read it before, treat yourself and read it again. And if you think you know of a funnier book, leave a comment - I always welcome tips!"

D Suggs,12/12,5.0,1064275200,Spicy History,"This is an outstanding anthology of cover art from the depression-era &quot;girlie pulps&quot; by such highly worthy (and undeservedly obscure) artists as H.J. Ward, Norm Saunders, and Enoch Bolles, among many others. To the best of my knowledge there's no other great source of their work in print (especially Bolles), but they're very well served here, and very little of the work seen here is reprinted elsewhere. The text is diligent, thorough, well-written, and interesting, covering the rise and fall of the magazine niche-industry that produced these amazing visual works; it is scholarly and will be of great interest and service to students of the subject, but the broader appeal- pun intended- is in the more than four hundred color images. These are beautifully reproduced at a generous size, and on slick, high quality pages. The overall design of the book is also excellent.I'd like to see another volume, perhaps including some of the interior art, if it's worth seeing. I've also been waiting for years for someone to do &quot;The Art Of Enoch Bolles&quot;- how about it, Mr. Ellis?The author's review below is very informative and interesting, with much more information about this worthy book."

The women in this book just weren't smart. They were actually quite clueless and not anything like anyone I'd ever want to know or spend time with. I suppose if you're a big reader of ""glamour lit"" this might appeal to you, but it was as if the authors pulled out every stop they could think of and every cliched character (the gay best friend, rich girls, poor girl, a make-over, lies to fool people, etc.).

Ballantine has a wonderful take on magic - Art as she calls it - and its relation to humans and the mythical Fey. The two races have a long history, expertly hinted at throughout Chasing the Bard. Ballantine expertly weaves together a tale of battle, heroism, love, honor, magic, and humanity for a wonderful story that pulls the listener into the world and keeps them begging for more."

Apparently half of her heritage is from a Protector while the rest comes from a mortal requiring Zoe to either register as an outcast or forfeit her superpower heritage. Zoe chooses to save the world with her powers.Meanwhile private detective George Taylor seeks a missing magical stone for a client. His investigation leads to Zoe, who seems eerily seems to be the center of weirdness on the planet. While George vows to learn the truth, Zoe needs no powers except her heart to tell her he is the one for her. As they fall in love, they team up to take on a malevolent attempt for world domination.APHRODITE'S KISS is an amusing fantasy romance along the line of &quot;Mom and Dad save the World.&quot; The story line is fun as Zoe behaves as if she is the Greatest American Hero except that she knows George is her other half. The romance adds spice to a fabulous tale that shows Julie Kenner saves readers who enjoy uniqueness in their novels from April showers.Harriet Klausner"

The Wolves of Willoughby Chase, by Joan Aiken (Doubleday 1962) takes readers on a suspenseful journey through 18th century England with memorable characters. Bonnie, a rambunctious and wealthy young girl, defies traditional ideas of what it means to be ""ladylike."" Her parents take in Cousin Sylvia, a gentle-mannered girl with little to her name save for a beloved doll and the love of an elderly aunt. Despite the terrifying wolves that prowl about the town and a deep concern for the aunt she's left behind in London, she is delighted to have the companionship of her cousin and the luxury of new dresses and toys.Sylvia's bliss is premature, however, as the wicked governess, Miss Slighcarp, soon reveals her devious ways, plotting against Bonnie's parents while they are away at sea, and sending the girls away to a miserable orphan school. Will Bonnie and Sylvia defeat their nemesis, or will she succeed in gaining the family's wealth and destroying their happiness? This tale of friendship, survival and adventure with subtle humor in the right places is a classic young-adult read."

Had he done that he wouldn't have produced Romeo and Juliet since he would be too preoccupied with getting his &quot;deep message&quot; across (so deep that it can be expressed in a sentence ... ), instead of writing a good play. Saint-Exupery did the exact opposite - it is evident that this book was written as some sort of philosophical manifesto on how adults do not appreciate life enough, as children do. The characters and plot are all secondary to that idea. The reader is reminded at every turn of this &quot;deep message&quot;, the end result being that the message and the book become vulgar, over-used, &quot;in-your-face&quot;. It personally bothered me a lot (and isn't this review personal, after all?). I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because Saint-Exupery obviously had a great talent for conjuring up lovely scenes - such as the famous one in which the prince asks him to draw him a sheep. But these scenes cannot act as an excuse to the endless preachings of this book. Did the author really give so little credit to his potential readers while writing this? ..."
B00085QGNM,"Nights with Uncle Remus;: Myths and legends of the old plantation,",,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,"Andre M. ""brnn64""",8/8,4.0,1294704000,Simply delightful!,"Most people today (sadly) think of Joel Chandler Harris' Uncle Remus/Br'er Rabbit tales as racist apologetics for slavery. A good read of this seldom-read book shows that this was far from the case.This volume came on the heels of the better-known ""Uncle Remus-His Songs and Sayings"" which consisted of tales of the black sage Uncle Remus (based on a real slave storyteller named ""Uncle"" George Terrell) telling trickster tales of Br'er Rabbit. In this book, the concept is expanded. Uncle Remus is joined by Aunt Tempy, a gullah-speaking African slave named Daddy Jack, and a teenage-twentysomething black girl named Tildy, in relating the stories to the little white boy. Their personalities are expanded here, including a love story between the elderly Daddy Jack and the young Tildy. Uncle Remus even candidly discusses the racism of poor whites against blacks in one scene (note to ""Song of the South"" fans, he was referring to the Favors family, who were the villians in that film).Although the nineteenth-century ""Negro dialect"" (once again) makes rough reading for modern readers, the results are well worth the effort. The stories are real knee-slappers, especially the tales of Brer Babbit tricking Brer Fox with a sleeping horse and the heroic hare's attempt to bamboozle a yooung girl into letting him feat from her father's garden. However, this book also shows that Harris far more than a white man who ""stole"" black folklore (as his detractors accuse). The character of Daddy Jack is among the most complex in the series and, having grown up around the Gullah culture near Charleston, SC myself, Harris very accurately records Daddy Jack's gullah stories and speech in these pages, which is a difficult task as this dialect does not easily lend itself to the written page. Those unfamiliar with gullah will find this a chore, but Harris includes a gullah glossary to help.The tale-telling sessions with the above four characters and the little white boy as a witness is also an accurate testimony to a storytelling session among Black southern adults, perahps the best description of its kind until Zora Neale Hurston's insider look at this phenomenon MULES & MEN in 1935 (I say this having witnessed such scenes myself as a child). Harris himself was privy to such sessions during slavery, and it shows. One delightful moment occurs when Uncle Remus tells the gathering about a chicken hawk flying downward toward a chiken in a barnyard and Tildy excitedly interjects, ""LOOK OUT, PULLETS!""With all this to recommend it, the only reason I give it 4 stars is because this Penguin edition is minus the wonderful illustrations of Arthur B. Frost (of the aminals in the stories wearing overalls, smoking pipes, etc.). No volume of Uncle Remus lore is complete without these highly amusing drawings adding to the fun. This will also whet your appetite for Harris' other Remus collections (Told by Uncle Remus, Uncle Remus & The Little Boy, Uncle Remus & Br'er Rabbit, etc.). However, the other Harris books are VERY hard to find today. Fortunately, a complete anthology of ""Remusology"" exists in ""The Complete Uncle Remus,"" which also includes the original delightful drawings from each book. I would highly recommend this after reading ""Nights With Uncle Remus."""

Johns ""ResQgeek""",1/1,3.0,1146614400,"Not bad, but missed a chance to be great","What would life be like as the mother of the messiah? What did Mary think, feel, believe? This book explores these questions. In the introduction, the author is quite candid about the idea of a written journal being anachronistic, but does point out that Mary is described in Luke's Gospel as a ponderer, just the kind of person who might have kept a journal in a different time and place. Here the auther extrapolates what Mary's life might have been like, and her portrait is both sympathetic and believable. We find a wife and mother, who gets caught up in the minutia of day-to-day life, and sometimes has to remind herself what her son's role is meant to be. Unfortunately, this book ends with the beginning of Jesus's public ministry, so that we don't get to explore Mary's reactions to her son's public role, or witness the agony of standing at the base of the cross when he was crucified. There was a great deal of potentially powerful material that is left unexplored. While this story is enjoyable and moderately inspirational, it might have been truly great if it had pursued the story to its end."

While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"

There are many full page illustrations that are simply amazing to look at. With a detailed style that occasionally reminds me of Graeme Base, he populates &quot;Wonderland&quot; with all sorts of exotic birds and animals, some of which aren't usually included in illustrated versions of Alice, such as anteaters, platypuses, hippos, etc. But they lend an air of strangeness to this imaginary world that nonetheless seems to be appropriate.

Mailer creates over a dozen detailed characters each living more in their own minds and agonies then in the war that pushes them forward.

There are millions of women out there who think it is perfectly acceptable to make someone love you by playing dumb, practicing deceit and manipulation, humiliating yourself by speaking/acting like a child to your husband, and allowing yourself to be used as a human doormat. Even more disturbing, there seems to be millions of men out there who get turned on by a wife who behaves this way. This book is a disgusting shameful example of what is wrong with Mormon women. I bet it is handed out to every LDS girl and particularly the sects who practice polygamy. I am certain my LDS next door neighbor practices the manipulative behaviors outlined in this book and she is one of the most exasperating idiots I have ever met. Trying to discuss any kind of topic with her is like talking with a stuffed animal. She has a vocabulary of an 8 year old and a blank stare and blank look to her face....completely utterly out to lunch....pretty fascinating alright....."

Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. ""Laurie"" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."

Though the plot of the story was quite good, there was not that much character development of the heroine. None of the characters captured my heart, and my attention just kept wandering. And while the hero's daughter was cute, she was a six-year-old who talked like a twenty-year-old. I know some authors do this as a cute character quirk, but this author treated the little girl's way of speaking as if it was perfectly normal. I just couldn't get into this story and ended up skipping to the second one about halfway through. Three stars.The second story (Sweet Sea Spirit) captured my heart and would not let it go. I had never read anything by Emilie Richards before, but her name is now on my list of authors to watch for. ""Sweet Sea Spirit"" a story I now read every year. This story was written entirely from the heroine (Sandy's) point of view, which was an interesting change from the head-hopping you often find in romance. Sandy is just wonderful, a sweet, plucky woman who marries a serious man and then tries to change herself into what she thinks he wants, not realizing that he fell in love with who she really is. This novella also had some touching ""big family"" moments, which I really enjoyed, but the main focus was on the romance - exactly where it should be. A wonderful story about being true to yourself, I get tears in my eyes every time I read it. Five stars.Though the first story is not worth the money, the second one more than makes up for it. Highly recommended!"

0802801269,Risen Indeed: Making Sense of the Resurrection,25.5,A3FZMYI7RA7E3P,"C. Price ""Layman, Lawyer, Blogger""",10/10,4.0,1092700800,Broad in Scope and Excellent in Substance,"In a field crowded by apologists, historians, and New Testament scholars, Stephen T. Davis may seem a bit out of place writing about the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus. He is, afterall, a professor of philosophy. As it turns out, his background in philosophy makes for a very gratifying book about the resurrection of Jesus (and the general resurrection of Christians).Davis covers a lot of ground. In Davis' own words, the book is ""a somewhat eccentric mixture of philosophy, Christian theology, New Testament scholarship, and perhaps even preaching."" He covers a lot of ground, but largely maintains its cohesiveness. Though the structure is abrupt at one place, Risen Indeed effectively brings together the philosophy, theology, and apologetics related to the resurrection of Jesus.In his first Chapter, Davis effectively engages the arguments of David Hume and Anthony Flew, which object on philosophical grounds to the possibility of evidencing miracles. To his credit, Davis takes them more seriously than do most apologetics for the resurrection. Additionally, Risen Indeed clearly makes important distinctions, such as the difference between ""soft apologetics"" and ""hard apologetics"", and the difference between a ""soft miracle"" and a ""hard miracle."" Davis concludes the chapter by noting that belief and denial of the resurrection of Jesus can be rational -- depending on the philosophical predisposition of the reader towards the possibility of a miracle. This sifting through the issues is very helpful in setting up the rest of Davis' ""soft apologetic"" for the resurrection.Chapters Two and Three also plow the ground for further discussion. In a common-sense manner, Davis reduces the argument that we cannot examine the historicity of the resurrection because it is an event ""outside of history"" or ""beyond historical inquiry."" Such arguments in my opinion are simply dodges by historians afraid of upsetting the religious or the religious afraid of being proved wrong by the historians. As Davis shows, the resurrection -- if it happened -- is a historical event that happened within time and space. As a proposition, it is possible to investigate it in a historical manner.Davis moves into the actual apologetic for Jesus' resurrection in Chapter Four--Resurrection and the Empty Tomb. He begins by responding to common objections against its historicity and concludes by arguing for the reliability of the New Testament accounts and noting the difficulty the early Jerusalem Church would have had in proclaiming his resurrection had the tomb not been empty. Both arguments are well made, but relatively brief. For fuller defenses of the empty tomb the reader should take note of Davis' references.The book then shifts gears. Rather than proceed directly to the resurrection appearances or further evidence of Jesus' resurrection, Davis discusses basic Christian theology about the implications of Jesus' resurrection to the coming resurrection of Christians -- which, he argues, will be a similar, bodily resurrection. The theology is sound, but makes a somewhat abrupt appearance. Such considerations proceed for three chapters before we return to the direct apologetic for Jesus' resurrection. Though a little out of place in sequence, these chapters are valuable discussions of resurrection theology. Probably more interesting, however, to Christians than others.Chapter Nine discusses the role of the resurrection in apologetics. It reiterates some points earlier made, and delves into the question of Jesus' resurrection appearances and possible alternative explanations of the resurrection. Davis' discussion is well done and effectively engages contrary views. But again, this is not a work of New Testament criticism and consultation with more detailed sources will be helpful (such as N.T. Wright's The Resurrection of the Son of God).Overall, this is an excellent book. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in understanding the nature of the reported resurrection of Jesus, the expected general resurrection of Christians, and the apologetics related to those events. It better sets the philosophical stage for such explorations than any book I have read."

I have visited Santiago Atitlan 3 times, once with students, and felt I had a small grasp of the religious practices. But I was wrong. Prechtel's account of his life with the shaman and the spiritual hierarchy of the village is an incredible revelation. The Maya tendency to keep their important beliefs secret, was much deeper and more significant to their culture than I could have guessed. Reading this book is a fascinating and up to now unavailable look at a culture that sees itself as an integral, unseparable part of nature and the universe. The connectedness experienced by the atitecos is something that we in our materialistic, compartmentalized culture have lost, or perhaps never have had. Prechtel offers us the chance to glimpse the underpinnings of the Maya belief system. His writing, that once in while seems overly flowerly, sets the scene to guide us into this magical world. His fascination with his own learning there does not lead him to idealize these indigenous people. There are sharp doses of reality in this book; of diseases and death, and hunger and feuds. To gain an amazing perspective into the lives of a fascinating people, I highly recommend Secrets of the Talking Jaguar."
B0007FLPB6,The Koehler method of dog training,,,,12/32,1.0,1059436800,Training? More like abuse,"This book is NOT, I repeat NOT a dog training book. This is a book for abusers. Sure I might look at it if I had the most ""vicious"" dog in the world, had tried EVERY other method of dog training in the world and it was a choice between this and death to the dog. Koehler's methods for problem dogs mightare unbeleviable. I was reading reveiws and one said stuff about Koehler's suggestions for digging holes, chewing, barking. I didn't beleive it, because it was clearly abuse. So I went to the library and looked at the book. For digging holes it went something like filling the digging hole with water stuffing the dogs head down into it and holding it there until the dog is convinced that he is going to drown. For chewing Koehler said to stuff the chewed object in the dog's mouth and tape the muzzle together so the dog could not spit it out. I have saved the last for worst, barking. Koehler suggested getting a belt and beating your dog with it when it barked.(If you don't beleive me go check the book out at the library) Now is that abuse or not? Hmmm.... For tradional trainers I reccommend the Monks of New Skete. For clicker trainiers I reccommend ""The Power of Positive Dog Training"" and last for people who want positive(not neccesary clicker) I reccommend Ian Dunbar's work. Last I beg, for the sake of your dogs, not to buy this book. It is very much wrong and and its ideas are abusive."

By the end of this early novel from Alan Furst, Casson is a marked and hunted man who has no place to go but away from France.How Casson's world is changed is subtle and murky, like a drizzly, foggy night. He takes an espionage assignment so he can visit his girlfriend. He joins a German-backed syndicate to insulate himself and then realizes if the Allies win he'll be in deep water. Throughout, the lulling calm of Paris-as-usual is slowly revealed to be a web of lies and wiretaps and betrayals.This work has the usual Furst contradiction of depicting the ordinary man trying to survive and trying to love his country while offering enough violence and heroism to keep the editors and readers happy.

He massages and negates equation 4.4 and adds something to both sides. He doesn't even appear to use equation 4.3. No hints of what he did. It would be no big deal except that he then says ""This mathematical identity is the key to identifying an invariant"" and proceeds to the final result, which is a critically important and fundamental formula.In other words he blows off explaining one of the most important steps in understanding special relativity as being ""straightforward"" even though he explains trivial observations/steps in detail. He may be an ""expert"" on gravity but this makes me wonder how well he actually understands what he is writing about.

Previous favorites of mine have been The Sound and the Fury, Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice. I saw Tess of the D'Urbervilles on my sister's bookshelf and for about a year I considered reading it. Finally, I picked it up and began. Wow! I read it in about three days. I never expected I would feel so much by reading this book. I cried when she baptized Sorrow herself. Her concerns that he be buried in the churchyard and her efforts to ensure he was were touching. I wanted to help Tess Durbeyfield. I thought she was a very complex character--she was sweet and unworldly but she wasn't actually stupid. And she was strong in many ways--for example, her family relied on Tess for so many things--eventually even their support. In fact, I hated her family for not working harder and making their own sacrifices. All the burden was on poor Tess. I also wanted to shake some sense into Angel. He really did wrong by Tess--although he eventually realizes this, it comes too late. The only thing I really did not care for was the sudden inclusion of a minor character (who we met earlier)into the end of the book and the implication that she would play an important role in the future of a major character. I barely knew this minor character and NOBODY could compare to Tess of the D'Urbervilles. If you are reading this to find a good book, ignore the negative reviews by high-school students and buy this book NOW. It's unforgettable."

Gary Valentine's book is by far the best look at Blondie's early years. It's a witty, funny, insightful view of the New York rock scene of the 1970's. Since Gary was a member of Blondie during their early days he has all the stories you could hope for about life with the band when they were just beginning and he lends insight into the creativity that went into the writing of his two most notable Blondie contributions - X Offender and Presence, Dear. Just about everyone you'd be interested in from this time period makes some sort of appearance in this book - Johnny Thunders, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, Captain Sensible, Tom Verlaine, etc. I will read this one over and over again. Gary takes a good long look at what differentiated the New York, London and LA punk scenes and it's one fun and fascinating read. If you are a fan of Blondie or the 70's glam or punk scene or the early 80's new wave scene then you must get this one!"

B000GQXSY8,Gone with the Wind,,A2JBML3I9KVLC9,"""rgittle""",4/4,5.0,1021507200,Gone With the Wind,"Gone With the Wind is a classic novel of love and loss. Taking place in a time and place which is, quite literally, &quot;gone with the wind,&quot; it is interesting in both a historical sense and a romantic one. This novel is often called &quot;the greatest love story of all time,&quot; and truthfully at that. There is nothing quite as stirring as the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell's classic writing and understanding of times gone by makes this one of my (and the world's) ultimate favorites. At this point, this novel has reached so much fame that it is hardly necessary to discuss the plot, but for those uninformed out there, here it is:Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful and headstrong eldest daughter of rich, high class plantation owners living just south of Atlanta during the antebellum period. Scarlett is the belle of the county - she has the smallest waist, the prettiest face, and the flirtiest personality. She could have any man, except the one she wants - Ashley Wilkes, who is already engaged to the frail but very sweet Melanie. When the Civil War breaks out everything changes. Scarlett marries, but is immediatly made a widow, and she moves to Atlanta to stay with Melanie. All the while Rhett Butler is lurking around. He's handsome, suave, and has a horrible reputation - hardly the kind of gentleman Scarlett was raised to like. But Scarlett, with her stubborn, headstrong attitude, brains, and independence is hardly a typical southern lady. As the war rages on, Scarlett's world is shattered and challenged. Wealth turns to poverty, pride to despair, admiration to dislike, and hate to love.Once started, this is a novel that cannot be put down. Many people read the whole thing (over 1,000 pages) in one very long sitting! That's what I did."

All I remember thinking was how disappointed I was from about the middle to the end. The book started out with excellent twists and turns, and I would constantly wonder about what each character would do, and where the book was going to go. Then, Hawthorne started dawdling and blabbing to an unnecessary extent. The book became boring. I was really disappointed, but _The Scarlet Letter_ is a worthwhile read just for the very human qualities of the characters."

Persuasive.,"David Kennedy believes that government health officials and the medical community at large are in the hip pocket of big drug companies. This conspiracy has caused important, effective, powerful remedies, like vitamin C, to go unnoticed and unsupported. History will tell whether he is right about that.What may be more important is that Kennedy and others believe Vitamin C can prevent and treat the avian flu. If this is true, Vitamin C can provide an inexpensive, powerful, effective treatment for a lethal virus.It now seems clear to every serious-minded person that the Asian Bird Flu is going to attack, the only question is when. When the epidemic strikes, it will be deadly and fast. According to Kennedy, mega-doses of Vitamin C will be effective in protecting people against the flu. For those that have it, he believes that mega-doses of Vitamin C, administered intrvenously, may save many lives.This book is mostly about the curative effects of Vitamin C. Based on studies and reports of it curing polio, cancer, and other deadly conditions, Kennedy, Linus Pauling, and others state that the health benefits of it are dramatically understated and even unknown.I don't know if Kennedy is right about the pharamaceutical industry, time will tell. If he is right about Vitamin C and the bird flu, our family will be protected by an inexpensive, easily-available remedy. If he is wrong, we will have taken a lot of Vitamin C.The highest potentcy in tablet form I am able to find are on amazon.com at 2000MG. Forget Tamiflu and pass the orange juice."

Clash's adventures up high, down low, and at sea level. The writer not only relates experiences few others have had but also demonstrates the skill to communicate them effectively and with poetics. Two interludes - one concerning his mountaineering friend Scott and the other about the wildflower and the Trinitite at the bomb site - proved particularly telling of the writer's story telling prowess. In addition, he paints the picture for the reader in several anecdotes about climbing and race car driving in such a way that it leaves the body wanting to touch what the reader's imagination can now grasp.But for all the good there is to say about the writing, I find myself uneasy about the book's prominently advertised intentions. Promoting the tie between adventure and business may enhance book sales but puncture some of the continuity of Clash's writing. On page three, Clash does a great job presenting: ""Let's face it, evolution has extracted the primal excitement out of a workweek ... baby boomers who find themselves trapped ... are forced to buy excitement."" Yet, in several sections Clash diverges, going many pages with little more than a passing stab at the relationship of business to adventure. While some chapters are innately tied to business, others, such as the first few, stray away from what is promised on the cover: a thread tying business and adventure. Clash may have overestimated the obviousness of the parallel between business success and adventuring success or occasionally tried to build the links into the writing as an afterthought. (This is the only issue holding it back from a 5-star rating.)Carving out those parallels between the disciplines is difficult and in at least a few places he neglected the task.Clash returned too often to the questions surrounding Scott's death in the first few chapters. I got the impression he was fascinated with death (aren't we all to an extent?). The Dalai Lama says that without a curiosity and respect for death, we can't have a true appreciation for life. However, in this book, he asked the question of too many interviewees and the issue became a reader distraction examining a particular event rather than an echo of the central theme of taking risk to achieve reward.Regardless of whether the book returns often enough or in enough detail to the adventure/business theme or whether Clash overemphasizes an episode, the story telling is compelling and sophisticated. The flow is mostly logical (although heavy emphasis on mountaineering early on makes me anticipate a full book on climbing experiences) and carry the book through to its conclusion. All in all, this is a heart-pounding adventure journal - thoroughly researched and written with passion - that I would recommend with the caveat that the reader not expect a full-blown discussion of adventure's relation to business."

An overview of the saint's life follows, and the translator's preface explaining his methodology. The translation itself reads smoothly, but it is not light. Fairly comprehensive notes are found at the end of the translation, and the editors have added an index at the end to assist in quickly finding useful passages.One can read it quickly, but to do so is a detriment to the reader. It is useful to remember that these exercises were conducted over the course of a month. Likewise when reading the book one must stop, reflect, think, and pray.

You would think a Phd in English Literature would do better research.Far worse than this is the plot which has the hero either making love to or verbally abusing his wife. His penchant for thinking his brother has been involved with his wife (and forgiving him but not his wife) and not bothering to investigate at all whether any of the gossip is true. I know that historical romance may have a bit of misunderstanding in it - but this level goes way beyond what is acceptable.

What fascinated me about Newton was his singleness of mind, a genius who devoted himself almost entirely to the pursuit of knowledge.Westfall's book is a condensation of an earlier book _Never at Rest_ which I have not had the pleasure of reading. Westfall presents the life of Newton warts and all. It describes his rise to prominence in the scientific world of his time and all the events leading to his most significant publication, the Principia.What was new to me was Newton's arguments with Hooke and his behavior toward Flamsteed which diminish the man's greatness, in my mind at least. What may be interesting to readers of Newton, the man, rather than the Scientist, are his `latter years' in public service at the Mint.Overall, I think Westfall kept the proper balance between presenting the works and person of the life of Newton.

(well, a little bit for me because i read the book wuite quickly, seeing as how i loved it) i kept saying betwixt instead of between, which i enjoy saying now because it makes me feel smarter than evryone else (jk).... anyway, i was the single person in my class that absolutely LOVED this book... the only thing that i didn't like was taking EXTENSIVE nots throughout the book, which ruins many of the other books we read (such as the amazing lord of the flies).... aside from that, the book is quite good... not only is dickens able to hold my attention through most of the book (when i say most, i;m excyuding the part where they are planning that escape with provis, which i thought was boring), which is a huge feet for someone such as charles dickens, who i expected to bore the living daylights out of me... overall, the plot is very good, but the messages that it carries are even better... pip is driven by greed all throughout the book, until he becomes mentally ill... when he realizes what he's done, he becomes a new person, and is at peace with himself... the realationship between him and estella is very complex, too.. until very late in the book, he is captured by her beauty, he partakes in a blind love for her. by the end of the novel, after all he has been through with her, he gains a true love for her based on her qualities, not because she is rich and beautiful.. this love was always there, he just did not uncover the exactness of it until he grew as a person through his sever low. so many vivid characters, i can't even explain how good the characterization is int he book... IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK, READ IT NOW OR YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED LATER ON!!!!!! if you can, read it twice, as i plan to (probably next summer, so it isn't so fresh in my mind)... group discussion on the book really accentuate the meaning of the book... the meaning is really deep, and most people don't catch all of it. the lake is much deeper than the top of the seaweed, don't be afraid to plunge to the bottom...though this book did not completely enlighten me and totally change my life, i did learn from it, which is something that rarely comes in spades. in this case it comes in spades, hearts, diamons AND clubs...enough rambling for me, im sure your not even going to read that whole review, it was quite long...review in a nutshell: good book with good messages (plural) and an engrossing plot... READ IT!!!!!other good books: bleak house by dickens (my man), heart of darkness by joseph conrad, farhenheit 451 by ray bradbury, lord of the flies by william golding, siddartha by herman hesse (not many people have read this, WHY?!?!!?!?!??!), don quixote by cervantes, old man and the sea by earnest hemmingway... can't think of any more off the top of my head... oh yeah, dracula by bram stoker...thank you, good bye"

Tolkein, and Jane Austen. Both these inspirations show strongly in ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell."" This book, set in an alternate-historical England during the Napoleonic wars chronicles the restoration of English Magic through the efforts of two magicians (the titular Messrs Strange and Norrell). Conflict builds between the magicians, and an immortal, amoral third party threatens the life and sanity of all.Written in a style adapted from Austen's classics (known as 'Free indirect speech' to the English students), ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"" is enthralling primarily because of the brilliant imagination of setting and characters. A continuous witty sense of humor combines with rich and believable (if fantastic) back story to create the feeling of something actually written in the nineteenth century. One entertaining extra is the wealth of footnotes explaining events both historical and fictional.One word of caution: This book has been presented as an action story like ""The Lord of the Rings"" or Harry Potter. This is not the case. ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"" is more ""Downton Abbey"" than ""24"". While absorbing and even exciting, this book is not thrill-a-minute.I recommend this book to all readers, but especially to the Ladies and Gentlemen with the patience to appreciate its depth and wit.If you can quote along with ""The Princess Bride"", or spend six hours with Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth with A&E;'s ""Pride and Prejudice"", this book is for you.Five out of five stars."

C. S. Lewis accomplishes this with consummate, and entertaining ease.While I am mindful that Mr Lewis has a decidely proselytic bent, it must be said that his stories deal with much more than the ongoing battle for the human soul (psyche). Mr Lewis's ability to evoke an otherworldly feeling is excellent transport away from our reality, and into the concept of what life means in a cosmic sense--perhpas this above all other forms of entertainment allows for a great evening read--trading our commute for floating islands in a desolate sea of movement and vibrancy.Once you get over the schmalz, which is similar to letting your eyes go out of focus to see the genius of Manet, you will find the book to be an excellent escapist treatise with enjoyable efforts at finding meanings in linguistics and behaviour, as well as a great adventure."

The main plot focuses on the protagonist describing the events of what happened to him and why he is recording everything. There are a couple of side plots dealing with his neighbor down the road, an old lady that knows all, and the jeapordy the town is in.The story is very identical to Stephen King's ""Pet Semetary"" which also has a doctor moving into a small town to take up a practice there. He is not happy with his current family situation and is apprehensive with the move to a small town. There is an old man and his wife as neighbors and he will take the doctor on a journey through the woods to show him the clearing that will become an important part to the story. The clearing is similar to the Micmac burial ground. They also have pets that are named after a famous people. In ""Pet Semetary"" the pet was called Church which was short for Winston Churchill, and in ""Deep in the Darkness"", the pet was called Jimmy Page or Page for short. There are more similarities, but to avoid spoilers you will have to look for them yourself.The ""Isolates"", to me, are a Lovecraft type of horror element. Basically a mishappen human style of subterrainian dweller that usually only come out at night. They are an ancient race that have been around for thousands of years.The writing in in the first person point of view which I do not care for much. Not saying that there are not good stories that are written using this style, I just think this story may have been better utilizing the third person POV. Most of the story for me was hard to get through. I just could not get into the writing as much as I would have liked. Even when I was wide awake, I would find myself nodding off while I was reading.The character developement was well done even though I couldn't get into them or their current delima. At first, it felt like the novel was just going to be a PG-13 type story with the worst of the language that was spoken being words like ""damn"" or ""hell"", but later as the story progresses, so too does the language that better fits the situation and builds as the situations become more irritable. There is also a well balance of the character decisions moving the plot as much as the plot moves the character decisions. The overall character development made sense and fit well.Minor criticisms1) The chosen POV. This is minor, but I, for one am not a fan of the first person so usually I hesitate reading books with this POV2) The main set up was just too identical to ""Pet Semetary"". This could have been intentionally done by the author or he may not have read the story in which it is identical to.3) The writing flowed, but felt bland. I felt that I had to push myself too much to get through the story and that there wasn't enough suspense or situations that made me want to see what was going to happen next.4) This has nothing to do with the author or the story, but is a major turn off when selecting a book to read. The publisher puts order forms smack dab in the middle of the book. If I wanted an informercial in the middle of a story, I would watch TV. The first thing I do is tear it out and that leaves a crease in the middle of the binding and this time I accidentally tore out one of the pages and didn't realize it and ended up thowing it away. Thankfully it was the ending of one chapter and the beginning of the next so I didn't miss much and was able to get the gist of what happened.Some positives that I found1) As I mentioned before, the character development was great. It all made sense and fit the character's personalities and change as it would realistically.2) The gore content, at times seemed a bit excessive, was good. This is a horror novel after all an if someone does not want to ready about blood and gore, need to read a different genre. I even liked how Mr. Laimo was able to add some humor to the gore.3) Speaking of humor, even though there was some humor in the novel; some chuckles, some laugh out loud, and some roll of the eyes type, ther could have been a bit more clever humor, but all in all, it worked.Overall this is an average horror novel. This was the first that I have read of Mr. Laimo and certainly will not be the last. He has named ""Dead Souls"" as his favorite work to date and so I will have to order it, since I can not find it in any bookstore around here. Taking into account that ""Deep in the Darkness"" is an earlier work, I will look forward to seeing what the later works have in store. I would recommend this book to those that need a huge amount fo blood and gore in their stories. If you are looking for a book that will scare you, this will probably not do it.A movie rating of this novel would be borderline ""R""/""NC-17"".Graphic violence, explicit blood and gore, strong language, and nudity."

As I'm sure anyone who's seen the 1980s movie (which was a pretty faithful adaption) already knows.

When I was a graduate student our professor called the book &quot;The poor man's Dirac&quot;--reference to the well-known treatise of P.A.M. Dirac. In fact, Rojansky covers, in a very clear fashion, Dirac's theory of the electron, a topic eschewed by many introductory books on quantum mechanics. One of my professors found fault with the fact that more than 70 intitial pages deal with mathematical preliminaries and classial mechanics. With respect to the latter, apparently he felt it was unnecessary for graduate students who, he assumed, had already spent at least one semester on a good course in classical mechanics. One failing is that Rojansky does not use Dirac notation, although he introduces the technique in the chapter on &quot;The Symbolic Method&quot;."

Further, it does not state what edition it is, but I assume the first... Around the turn of the century, Darwin's theory suffered a temporary (academic) setback, which was due in part to fallacious theories of inheritance then held; yet with the adoption of Gregor Mendel's ideas, this changed, and Darwin's ideas were back in full vogue. It took a little time though, naturally, and so, in 1950, for the World's Classics series, G. R. De Beer would write a new preface for what would be a reprinting of Darwin's final edition, the 6th, with ""all additions and corrections"".

However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: ""art is important,"" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like ""Great Expectations"" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."

The view of the small minority involved in ""radical Islam"" and their violent approaches toward both Muslims and non-Muslims get most of the attention from the rather uninformed popular press in the west.This renowned Muslim scholar speaks in terms westerners can understand, and writes from a broad perspective to analyze and critique the various movements acting in violence in the name of Islam. He shows us how these aberrant groups contrast with the vast majority of Islam, how they have perverted history and selectively chosen certain aspects that focus on their control or others.You will see here how these usurpers are seen by most who constitute the vast majority of followers of Islam. El Fadl discusses what the mainline Muslim majority need to do to reclaim their faith and project the broader traditional view of Islam and its practices and teachings, in order to inform westerners and reclaim their movement from the violent usurpers.El Fadl demonstrates clear and detailed knowledge of the Qur'an and Sunna and historical factors and streams of thought and politics in the Muslim world.

They set out to solve a death that appears to be a suicide overdose, but to Harry's perspicacious eyes have see too many in congruencies to be content with appearances.The story is well-hewn, but not as taut, as some of the other Bosch novels. Parts VI, VII, and VIII (about 100-200 pages, depending on edition) especially could be radically reduced with a finer sheen. The story sort of drags to bring in some characters that have only incidental merit to the overall plot.As a Californian, I knew many of the acronyms and numerical titles for PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), 405 (San Diego Freeway), 10 (Santa Monica Freeway), but Connelly uses these shorthand equivalents in a way that might make the distant reader feel confused. He's given to using these initials in the text (such as O.M. for Old Man), that's rather offputting.Overall recommended."

The role of mark to market accounting in allowing and even encouraging companies to mislead investors with false financial statements is convincingly explained. What I missed, however: the analytic side that would show the extent to which derivatives trading losses (was there a net gain or loss, how big?) fanned the flames of the financial instability and spurred on the drive to report imaginary profits from newly-created sub-ventures. The greatest failure of the book is to present individuals as the culprits instead of focusing on the deregulated economic system that the high-rollers operated within. This is related to the historic failure of the Democratic Party in our era, to have bought into the belief that unregulated free markets are stable and provide the best of all possible worlds. Empirical analysis of financial market data teaches us otherwise. For qualitative information about how the idelogy of unregulated free markets has systematically produced negative results in the third World, see Stiglitz's book ""Globalization and It's Discontents""."

B000KW0GVG,Crime and Punishment,,A93UWZK7BS806,"""d_kenall""",1/3,3.0,910051200,"Aesthetically inspired, but bereft of interest","Critiqued independantly of other novels and evaluated on its own intrinsic merits, Crime and Punishment reveals itself to be a irrefutably excellent novel. Nevertheless, in comparison to other &quot;classics,&quot; it lacks vitality, vitiated by the author's interminable and relentless prose concerning mostly the internal psychoses of a protagonist non-representative of humanity in general. Far better 18th-century novels redolent with evocative imagery and possessing greater thematic depth deserve attention; namely, the Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. Melville immerses the reader into a philosophical epic; Dostoyevsky harasses the reader. Hawthorne envelopes the reader's senses in prose so sumptuous it borders on decadence; Dostoyevsky austerely moves along his plot. Wilde smirks sardonically at his hero; Dostoyevsky throws him in our face. To recapitulate, Fyodor has some excellent ideological intrigue within his work--though mostly only a reactive jerk against radical philosophies of his time. His flaw, I believe, lies in his inability to entice the reader into the story, keep him there, and finally send him on his merry way with the satisfaction of having undergone cleverly-wrought enlightenment. I warily entered the story, stayed due to my own inertia, and then finished on my apathetic way, having undergone stale enlightenment."

I was curious as to why the Book of Enoch did not appear in either the King James version of the Bible or thecurrent Catholic Bible. I looked forward to receiving this bookfrom Amazon. It is hard cover, and very nicely presented. Itssomething I can add to my book collection. The author very carefully footnoted everything. I learned a great deal. But oneoutstanding fact came to light. Both the Catholic Church and all the Protestants ripped out this book from the Old Testament, even though the Book of Enoch was in the Bible for over 500 years.Some preachers say that the Book of Enoch was not ""divinely"" inspired. However, the author's clear presentation of thisancient scripture shows that Enoch, the great grandfather ofNoe, foretold the Great Deluge. Chapter 84 is devoted to ""Enoch'sPrayer"" which asks God to not destroy all persons, but to atleast leave Enoch with survivors in his family. The Book ofEnoch probably came under political scrutiny because it talksof all the interactions between angels (both good and bad angels)and human beings. There was also some astronomical data presentedwhich probably contradicted offical Church positions during the eras of Cupernicus and Galileo. I was quite impressed by the volume. I came away from my complete read of the volume with theattitude that it should be considered a legitimate book of theBible. Enoch's prayer in Chapter 84 is on the same level as theLord's Prayer of the New Testiment. Now I am wondering what elsehas been either left out or removed from the Bible.....? I shall definitely be purchasing other volumes from Amazon to try toanswer that question."

B000GQVYC6,THE CHOSEN,,A3HRT2SK06XPOC,Manav Malhotra,1/1,4.0,1063756800,The Chosen,"Like few authors have, Chaim Potok vividly illustrates the precious bond of friendship and its profound impact on choosing one's destiny as well as one's path to becoming a man. From worldly issues of war to personal issues of faith, Potok delves deep to provide a moving story.Potok subtly but brilliantly depicts the inability of humans to get along with each other. In the midst of WWII when the Jews are experiencing extreme persecution, still they bicker with members of their own faith over rather trivial issues. While the central conflict is between the two Jewish sects, many other more underlying conflicts exist. Potok illustrates the existence of conflicts inside conflicts thoroughly enough to show that that this situation does not just apply to the Jewish faith. From a Hasidic Jew to Liberal Jew, Hindu to Punjab, Shinto to Taoist, Chinese Buddhist to Shin Buddhist, humans have an incapability of keeping peace and good nature not only with each other but within their own faith as well.On a less global matter, Potok also portrays the difficulties of the transition from adolescent to adult from the perspectives of two Jewish boys. A young Hasidic Jew named Danny struggles with choosing his path in life. He wants to please his rabbi father by becoming a rabbi himself, but at the same time yearns to have the close bonded relationship his best friend Reuven has with his father so he can tell him that his true passions in life lie away from a strict Jewish life. Reuven struggles with his father's illness as well. Their paths to manhood are twisted and rocky, but each boy makes the trip with the other's friendship.The theme of friendship is explored comprehensively as well. Despite Potok's tone of multiple conflicts, the two boys of very different Jewish background come together to form a bond carried through the toughest of times. During a long-term separation they both find a piece of themselves missing and are not really happy until reunited.The novel is an inspirational story of a struggle between paving your own path in life and walking one paved, while all at the same time making sure the path leads you to happiness. Potok always makes sure you feel for the character in every situation and in turn teaches lessons to be applied to all of our lives."

The narrator is a ""renovation worker""--i.e., ""sanitation engineer""--at an asylum for the criminally insane in the south of France. The institution occupies the buildings of La Poudriere, a former munitions depot with a stone tower (the powderhouse), which is surrounded by a large park; the renovation worker occupies one of the outlying peasant cottages and has a delightful little sunlit garden. Here he rests from his daily chores, eating simple but satisfying meals, drinking a variety of wines, entertaining guests, sometimes smoking hashish, sometimes taking a hit of LSD, sometimes enjoying the embraces of a little brown nurse and every night feeding a friendly hedgehog. His chief occupation after cleaning the grounds is writing The History of Bestiality, and his discussions with visitors deal either with this theme or with the doings of madmen. Nevertheless, the halcyon air of the garden lends a pastoral atmosphere to the proceedings, an idyllic enchantment to recitations of the most zealous campaigns of carnage in history. Thus paradise, realized here and now, is contrasted with the hell that has become the wide earth, and the reading is oddly both horrifying and delightful at the same time.Bjorneboe gives more attention to form in this novel. He draws a series of colorful characters with independent roles, creates a bit of a murder mystery and devises a mechanism for the insertion of factual horrors: Dr. Lefevre, the chief of staff, believes that it is good therapy for residents of the Powderhouse to deliver and hear lectures on themes that disturb them. Thus three long lectures are laid out in chronological order and provide a solid structure to the six-chapter novel, leaving no gaps, expanses of uncertain time or cessation of forward movement as in MOMENT OF FREEDOM.The centerpiece is the second lecture, delivered by an inmate named Lacroix. It has no title, but might be called ""Sympathy for the Executioner."" Speaking from experience, Lacroix reminds his audience that executioners carry out the will of society; they are hired for their ""special qualifications,"" paid with taxpayer money and approved for their performance. They execute criminals legally condemned to death by a court, yet they are shunned and despised by society. He then bemoans the difficulty of killing people neatly, especially when they turn to the executioner and ask for a speedy dispatch. Each method of execution designed to be merciful, such as long-drop hangings, beheadings and firing squads, proves to be unreliable, so that the executed may struggle to live for a long time. For the executioner these experiences are ultimately debilitating; the profession brings physical and mental illnesses and often leads to suicide. Although approved by society, the executioner bears the blood of the human race and stands guilty before humanity and before God; but who, Lacroix cries out in despair, who thinks of him?The speech is nothing less than a masterpiece of world literature, as piercing in its humor as Voltaire's CANDIDE (1759) and as consistent in its wrong logic as Desiderius Erasmus' IN PRAISE OF FOLLY (1511). It takes the reader into an extreme reach of black humor which passes beyond definition--something way over the top, revoltingly gruesome and wildly hilarious and close to the quick at the same time. After this, the novel tends to get preachy, yet it deserves to be read for its entrancing mood and its flashes of bitter genius. Once again, the work is beautifully translated by Esther Greenleaf Murer."

The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."

This book was published in the early dark days of World War II (1942 second edition, hardback, Zondervan Pub.) when the dictatorial Axis Powers were at their apex in fighting the democratic Allied Nations (excluding the Soviet Union) -- although it may not have looked that positive to the Allies at that time. From this book's forward: ""The International Missionary Council appointed Dr. H. Kraemer, of Leyden University, to prepare a volume for the Madra meeting (1938) on the [Christian] evangelistic approach to the great non-Christian faiths, and to define the fundamental position of the Christian Church as a witness-bearing body in the modern world.....An emasculated Christianity has no power of propaganda and no missionary passion. The present-day trend of theological thought, however, is away from yesterday's naturalism and relativism. So we have tried in this little book...to weigh the overwhelming evidence for the genuineness of Christ's Great Commission and for the finality of His teaching. Three chapters deal with the place of Jesus Christ in the Old and New Testaments; five chapters with the Great Commission, its authority and its implications; while the remaining chapters tell of apostolic aims, methods, dynamic, qualifications, message and call.""The chapter subjects are: 1-The missionary background of the Old Testament and the Fullness of Time. 2-The Finality of Jesus. 3-The Universality of Jesus. 4-The authenticity and genuineness of the Great Commission. 5-The last twelve verses of the Gospel of Mark. 6-The Fivefold Commission. 7-The beginning at Jerusalem. 8-Israel in God's Program. 9-The Apostolic Aim and Goal. 10-Apostolic methods. 11-The apostolic dynamic. 12-Apostolic qualifications. 13-The apostolic message. 14-What constitutes a Call.A well written appeal for Christians to head the call to become a witness and to become an evangelicalist. For those already familiar with the author, Samuel Zwemer, one knows that one is in for an always high-class, fine work of Biblical scholarship.

This is certainly not as good as that book, but it's still darn good (especially for a first novel). As with ""Warbreaker,"" Sanderson has come up with something unique as the driving force behind a book's universe. Ditto in that the book is entirely self-contained, is well-described, and has several unforeseen and clever plot twists.My biggest problem with the book is the pacing: the first half of the book drags. There are a lot of things being developed, but not too much actually happening. Then, at the midpoint, things pick up dramatically (and even more so at about the 3/4 point). Also, there are one or two places where the main characters seem to have brain failure and fail to grasp something when all the pieces have finally been laid out in front of them. Finally (and most trivially), for no reason I can come up with, I had a tough time keeping the characters' names straight. The names are sufficiently different from each other and, for the most part, even follow a cultural naming scheme. But, I was constantly trying to keep name attached to character.Regardless of those gripes, this is still a very good book and I rate it at 4 stars out of 5."

What were the key differences between Eurasia and the rest of the world that led to Europe having the wherewithal in 1492 to conquer the Americas, instead of vice-versa. The book makes a strong case for geographic and biological environmental factors, and argues strongly against factors involving presumed differences in the human 'races'. The geographic factors seem to be but common sence, (once Diamond has explained them!) The biological environmental factors are more technical, and cannot really be evaluated by the lay reader, but they are of such importance that I would like to see more professional-level reviews.

Part of the motivation for writing this book is to put out, for public discussion and edification, a strong theory to explain how Europeans/Asians &quot;got ahead&quot;. As Diamond points out, many of us think about this very question, and many of us are stuck with unpalatable 'common sence' answers along the lines of &quot;Native Americans (African, Aboriginal Australians) are naturally primitive&quot; or &quot;The Cultures developed by non Europeans are all fatally flawed (by warlikeness, laziness, conservatism, communism, etc.)&quot; I, myself, have wondered about this, and I am too politically correct (which is now an insulting stereotype in-and-of itself) to want to adopt, or even toy openly with any of these race-cultural supremacist theories. But the underlieing question is so important, we MUST discuss it, and get this kind of thinking out into the light of day, where it can be rigorously analysed and judged. Diamond allows us to do this by producing a thorough, well supported theory, covering almost every aspect of this problem. He shows how it can be solved with out recourse to the &quot;I guess those people are jest backward&quot; thinking. Whether all of the answers he suggests and supports will turn out to be the final ones, is certainly open to debate.The only drawback I would point out to his book is that he does get a little repetitious. Another serious round of editing would have helped. But perhaps repetition is not necessarily a bad idea in driving some of his ideas home...As for his reviewers... One reviewer thought Diamond's position is that Whites represent the pinnacle of modern society and that no one can usurp this distinction. This is silly. Diamond is attempting to figure out what gave Whites/Europeans their big edge in 1492. That they had this edge is difficult to dispute. He says nothing about whether they will keep it. Most of his arguments relate to cultures in isolations vs. those which are not. Since none of us are very isolated anymore (at least compared with the kinds of isolation some peoples had in pre-European-exploration times), his work cannot be said to make any projection about continued &quot;white&quot; dominance.Some reviewers complain his work is unoriginal. I'm sure that other experts in this field know that some of his theories and arguments did not spring, unaided, from his mind alone. I never had the impression that he was attempting to make us think so, either. He certainly cites enough other references... His great accomplishment is a clear, persuasive synthesis of ideas that can be read and appreciated by the non-expert.One reviewed scoffed that Diamond is unduly wedded to the idea that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;. I didn't get that impression from reading Diamond either. He does suggest that all peoples have their share of geniuses though, which I think would be difficult to disprove.He is also thought to undervalue the importance of culture. This is possible, but on the whole I disagree. Diamond is talking about very long time scales. I think that when we are talking about thousands of years, the physical constraints on the people are more important than any voluntary cultural decisions they make. As Diamond points out, any large number of people will have some groups who are willing to try new things, or who HAVE to try new things because they have been cut out of the best real estate. Over thousands of years, those who avail themselves of the most successful possible food or technology will tend to automatically shut out the others. This may not be observable over a period of tens of years, when cultural factors could easily conquer enlighted self-interest; maybe cultural factors could even triumph over 100's of years. But I think Diamond is more likely to be correct that over the time scale HE is interested in, the boundary conditions (availability of plants, animals and minerals) control the problem.Another complaint is that he does not adequately explain why the Fertile Crescent, with its big head start, or China &quot;won&quot; the domination of Eurasia and hence the world. I'd say that the answer to this problem is not the purpose of Diamond's book. The answers to this that question are more the province of conventional, relatively modern history, in which transient cultural factors may prove far more important than the &quot;initial conditions&quot; or &quot;boundary conditions&quot;. Reviewers who wanted to find the solution to that problem clearly should have read another book, or perhaps be writing their own."
0060095288,Fire Lover,7.99,AH3ZQ8AVKKYI5,Sammy Madison,4/4,5.0,1166486400,exciting true crime!,"""Fire Lover"" is an very exciting and well-written true crime book by Joseph Wambaugh, the author famous for writing ""The Onion Field"". The descriptions of fires, vehicle chases and other action sequences are so clear and thrilling you really feel like you are there. It drew me in from the very beginning, with an extremely realistic account of three simultaneous and deadly fires in Pasadena, California businesses on October 10, 1984. Clues eventually lead to arson investigator John Orr as the arsonist in these and a series of other fires. Orr, it turns out, was a legend in his own mind who used the fire investigation as the basis for a poorly written book. I was glad that Wambaugh did not neglect Orr's early life. I always want a true crime author to answer the question ""why"", and there was more information about Orr's background than I had expected. Fascination with fire is a big indication of psychopathology. I did a little skipping, though. Emphasis on the scenes inside the courtroom got a little tiresome. Well-written and very vivid, ""Fire Lover"" is by far one of the best true crime books I have ever read."

And although it is all so obviously simple in the end, Christie does a wonderful job at making the reader, as well as her detective hero, believe otherwise. I also liked this one because it is narrated by Poirot's trusty sidekick, Captain Hastings(Christie's version of Dr. Watson)who ordinary man that he is, proves invaluable to Poirot, and ultimately is the one person who can help him.I Strongly recommend to any Christie fan, or anyone who just likes a good mystery now and then."

B000Q5KL9O,Life & Opinions of Tristram Shandy,,A3DF7LMEQOND63,Frikle,56/57,5.0,1073865600,An 18th century modern novel,"This work is OLD but reads like the most innovative avant-garde novel of today. The book is about Tristram Shandy and his birth, his uncle and his war wound and his father with his love of names and noses. Seriously! This is the original story-with-no-story and the beauty of the book is in the way that it's written. In reality, Sterne talks about anything and everything. He makes digressions lasting 20 odd pages, rambles to the reader, apologises for rambling, then discusses how he plans to get the story finally under way.The book is out of order chronologically. One of the funniest things about the book is that it's meant to be an autobiography of the fictional Tristram. Half the book is spent telling the story of the day of his birth. Then, the author moves to another scene, mainly revolving around Tristram's uncle Toby and the novel finishes several years before Tristram's birth.Sterne's writing is chaotic resembling a stream of consciousness. Sentences run onto the other, there's heaps of dashes and asterisks being used for various purposes. Sterne adds scribbles to signify the mood of the character. When one character dies, to symbolise his end, Sterne has a black page to describe it. When introducing a beautiful female character, Sterne says he can't be bothered describing her so he leaves a blank page for the reader to draw his/her own rendition.The book - though technically not a satire - in the process of going nowhere and saying nothing makes fun of many religious, political and societal topics. Sterne was a minister but from the book it can be gleaned that he was a particularly irreverent one.The work is divided into 9 books, published serially. This is a work where you can just pick up a chapter and read it. Some are several pages. Others are two lines. It takes a while to get used to Sterne's writing &quot;style&quot; so read slowly. This goes for the whole novel as there's so much hidden underneath the surface.This edition is great in having footnotes on the same page and reviews of Tristram as well as critical essays and Sterne's own letters about the work - many of which are very good.Tristram is funny, ridiculous, clever and very very eccentric.

B000O3IRCQ,Cage of Stars: A Novel,,A3SUD7WHS9KI57,Cassie W.,2/2,5.0,1163635200,Mitchard brought me to tears with this one...,"Twelve-year-old Veronica ""Ronnie"" Swan is used to babysitting her younger sisters while her parents are out running errands. Her family lives in a settlement in Utah too small to be called a town, surrounded by members of the Mormon church to which they belong -- their life is a peaceful one, a life of faith, solitude, and simplicity. But a game of hide-and-seek while she's babysitting her sisters changes Ronnie's life forever. The novel begins as Ronnie is called out from her hiding place by her sisters' strange silence, only to find Becky and Ruthie lying on the ground beside the picnic table, blood like ""great dark pools of paint"" gushing from their slashed throats. Their killer -- later identified as Scott Early -- is sitting beside her sisters, mumbling to himself, still holding the scythe he used to kill them.Scott Early is diagnosed with schizophrenia and is sentenced to spend three years in a mental hospital, a verdict that Ronnie can't accept. She is angry, and she can't let go of the guilt she feels for being unable to save her sisters. Just before Scott Early is released from the mental institution, Ronnie's parents decide to offer him their forgiveness -- but Ronnie refuses to accompany them. She can't forget what Scott Early did, and she can't forgive him.But her life will forever be intertwined with that of her sisters' killer. Four years later, when she has enough credits to graduate from high school, she is drawn to San Diego, where Scott Early lives with his wife and infant daughter. Ronnie begins taking classes to become an EMT, and she convinces Scott Early's wife to hire her as a nanny for their daughter, Juliet. Once she has settled herself in the Earlys' life, Ronnie beings to plan her revenge on her sisters' killer -- and you won't believe the results.Talk about a roller-coaster of emotions: CAGE OF STARS takes you through them all. After the earth-shattering opening scene, the reader is left feeling devastated and heartbroken and utterly involved in the Swans' grief. And Mitchard keeps us there, relentlessly, by giving us a narrator so believable and sympathetic we can't help but be hooked. Ronnie's voice is pure and childlike; her tone is conversational and forthright; her observations are are both simple and wise beyond her years. Her innocence will break your heart. And in addition to giving readers a brilliant heroine, Mitchard also gives us a complicated, sympathetic villain. She brings us inside Scott Early's life, makes us understand his illness -- and while we don't root for Scott Early, we do pity him, and, unlike Ronnie, we don't begrudge him his happiness or his family.In CAGE OF STARS, Mitchard has taken us inside the Mormon community, a religion little-explored in contemporary fiction but much persecuted in the mainstream media. She debunks lots of stereotypes about Mormons here, as well as gives interesting information about their beliefs. A Mormon community (or any religious community, for that matter) is the perfect place to set a story like CAGE OF STARS: a story with forgiveness and redemption at its heart.I tore through this book in a day; I just couldn't put it down. And when I reached the perfectly-nuanced ending, I couldn't help but shed a tear for the characters. CAGE OF STARS is a powerful, moving book about the nature of forgiveness, and I'd definitely recommend it."

But Truly really said ""I don't think the shots came from this area. [The Book Depository]... In my opinion the shots came from behind the railyard.""According to Posner the shot whhich struck James Tague was fired in frame 161 of the Zapruder film. But at that point Tague would not even be in the shooter's line of fire. And the Warren Commission had already excluded this theory because a tree would have blocked the building.His arguments against conspiracy buffs are on the level of 'South Park.' Instead of attemping to debunk Jim Garrison's case he calls Garrison a child molester. Garrison was married with four children. This shows how he has no real arguments to make against Garrison.Even if you support the lone assassin theory, this book is worthless to you because it's filled with lies.Read 'Crossfire' by Jim Marrs.

B000NOWYR0,Tender Is the Night,,A32LS1Y4UA85AC,Lauren Davis,2/9,4.0,1049760000,Should you read Tender is the Ngiht?,"The novel Tender is the Night by F.Scott Fitzgerald, a tragic romance, is about a young 18 year-old actress named Rosemanry Hoyt, and her realtionship with the Diver's, an American couple. Their realtionship starts off with a growing friendship, which leads to Dick's (the husband)downfall and causing his wife to marry another man. The setting allows the reader to understand life during the 1920's before the time of the Depression, with close attention to characters and how our ways of living have evolved since the 1920's. F.Scott Fitzgerald uses a style of writing to fit both the time period and the setting of the novel.With F.Scott Fitzgerald being born in 1896, he has first hand knowledge about a time period important to our country's history that most of can only read about. He depicts the life of a young actress trying to fulfill her dream and a sophistaicated couple whose wealth forces them to live a life that they do not desire, and have to be people that are not. Dick is a brilliant psychiatrist who has an affair on his wife who enters into many clinics for a mental breakdown brought on by sexual abuse from her father. I can see why the novel may have received mixed reviews in 1933 when it was published. Even though life during the 1920's is depicted (in which it seems to me) accurately, but the plot of the novel is not what you would expect.

Since, I've read it with some degree of regularity and consistancy.At my first reading, I fully appreciated the stonework that Miller layed in the concrete plot, but didn't grasp the rich symbolism which makes it a terrifying yet truthfulinsight on human nature. Miller has written a novel that unravels the horror of mankind's fate in a way that gives me the sense that our destiny, not only is one thatcannot be changed, but it is a destiny that should not be changed"
B000P3VCZE,The Problem of Pain,,A1R4VHGGF1H23Y,Joseph Morse,1/3,5.0,1174435200,More great insight by a brilliant man,"According to the Author, Lewis took up the daunting task of trying to understand why pain exists if a good God exists too on a suggestion from a colleague. He notes in the book that figuring the problem of pain out started out as a duty, then quickly became an immense pleasure. Reading the book may give the reader the same progression of feelings. One may feel the urge to confront the deep question of pain and how that impacts one's faith is an obligation to be met grudgingly against one's will. However, while delving into the work, one will find it extremely pleasurable as the author reveals that there really isn't a problem of pain. The question eventually evolves from why, in a world created by a good and all-powerful God, is there pain and suffering to why, in some instances, is there a lack of pain.Lewis illustrates his resolution of this problem eloquently and sufficiently, though concisely. The book could be much longer and still not fulfill every but, though, or what if created by these major life concepts.I recommend ""Mere Christianity"" over this book, but suggest that this is a great supplement. While some ideas overlap, there is much to be learned by each book."
0765312557,P.I. on a Hot Tin Roof: A Talba Wallis Novel (Talba Wallis Novels),,AJ0PZR3WH7MNC,J,3/4,2.0,1127001600,Slo-o-o-w,"This is now the third of the Talba Wallis series. I like Julie Smith - especially Skip Langdon series, also set in New Orleans, and the Rebecca Schwartz series.That's why I've kept up with Talba Wallis books but I find P. I. on a Hot Tin Roof to be a marginally interesting book. The threads of the story have promise but seem to get mired down in detail, complicated by Talba's other life as a poetess, writing/reading as ""Baroness de Pontalba"". In all, I found this book to be a slow, rather stilted effort, in which the ""mystery"" almost is lost in all the attempts at portraying the idiocyncratic behavior of the multitude of characters, none of whom comes across with much force or depth. Maybe it's what seems to me to the self-consciousness of a white woman trying to write in a young black woman's voice. It's an OK read but I wouldn't put it at the top of your list."
B000EZUHNG,Captain Corelli's Mandolin,,A1EB2BH7WONIG6,Ian Richards,6/6,5.0,977875200,An Unforgettable Read,"I decided to read this novel out of interest both as a musician, and as an A-Level English Literature student. After two chapters I was hooked, and could not put the book down. The thing that puts this novel head and shoulders above all the others is the brilliant characterisation - as a reader, you begin to care for Pelagia, the doctor's daughter; Mandras, her fiance who has been left physically and psychologically scarred by the war; Carlo, the brave but gentle Italian homosexual; and of course, the eponymous Captain Corelli. The writing style also plunges the reader through a range of emotions. The book goes from being hilariously funny, to poignant, to brutally shocking. You cannot help but laugh at a chapter written entirely from Mussolini's viewpoint, in which 'Il Duce' demands that the temperature of Italy be lowered in order to increase the resilience of the Italian youth! Likewise, when an Italian character has his head split by a Greek bullet, and asks Carlo to break the news to his mother, the poignancy is unbearable. De Bernieres' description of Corelli's music is so vivid, you can almost hear the pieces he plays, and the depiction of battles is also brilliant. This book will open your eyes to the fact that not all of the Fascist troops in the Second World War were maniacs - some, like the fictitious Captain Corelli, were ordinary people caught up in a savage conflict."

Clark,4/7,5.0,918604800,A Masterpiece of Philosophical Literary Fiction,"As a Christian, I consider this book essential reading for all Christians. Dostoevsky argues, sometimes covertly, for the essential tie between morality (conscience) and God. The famous quote, &quot;If God does not exist, everything is permitted,&quot; assumes that without an objective moral God, everything is objectively amoral (even if subjective morals exist). To me, the novel shows how some (not necessarily all) professing atheists try to philosophically justify their actions that would otherwise be considered immoral. The way they justify their immorality is to subjectivize (relativize) all morality thereby making everything, including murder, inherently amoral. The problem with this approach is that the protest against evil becomes subjective and objectively collapses. Absolute good (God) defines absolute evil. Without God, absolute evil can't exist and Ivan's examples of human cruelty lose their force by becoming objectively excusable types of behavior. Dostoevsky also brilliantly shows the bankruptcy of human courts of justice. We the readers know that Dmitri is innocent of the death of his father, but the evidence makes him look guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt... If there is no just God and life after death (immortality), then we're stuck with human injustice masquerading as justice and no hope of the wrongs in this life being righted in the next. Aside from these Christian topics, the brilliance of Dostoevsky's work is that many atheists such as Camus, Sartre, Nietzsche and Freud have found this work a masterpiece. Dostoevsky showed that saints can look like sinners and sinners can look like saints and we are left wondering who is actually innocent or guilty of what. Read the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation.After reading this novel, check out Franz Kafka's &quot;The Trial.&quot; Kafka was another great who learned from Dostoevsky. - Brad Clark"

B000KORO82,"Little Women or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.",,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",1/1,5.0,1116547200,"Little women, growing up","Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but ""Little Women"" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of ""Little Women"" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, ""poor little rich boy"" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to ""Little Women."" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- ""scribbling"" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But ""Little Women"" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as ""heartwarming"" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the ""perfect little homemaker"" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.""Little Women"" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."

B000PEHLVC,The scarlet letter: a romance,,AGEIT17HENDIS,Alfred Johnson,0/0,5.0,1271980800,In The High Puritan Style- Again,"I started off a review of the more famous of 19th American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories by noting that the old social democratic literary critic and editor of ""Dissent"", Irving Howe, once noted that Mark Twain, and his post-Civil War works represented a dramatic break from the Euro-centric ante bellum American literary establishment. And on this question I agree with him. As I do on his choice of Nathaniel Hawthorne as an exemplar of that tradition. Certainly his most famous work, ""The Scarlet Letter"", reflects that European influence, and is justly place in the pantheon of that handful of important works that emerged in the early days of the American Republic.One of the of clearest links the ante bellum American literary establishment and the European tradition, especially from the English tradition was the need to pose and resolve some high moral question. And of course what is simpler to do that go back to the stark and isolated foundations of the white American tradition, the Puritan tradition. I know that if I were a writer and I wanted to dramatically portray the effects that physically isolated (and isolating) religiously-driven communities have on the individual, and on individual choice, those Puritan settlements from Cape Cod to Salem on the coast of Massachusetts in the 1600s would, at least get my serious consideration.So that, in part is what drives the action (if one can use that term usefully here) of a woman (naturally) banished from the tight-knit community (or so they claimed) by running off and having an affair with Mr. X. Now today that would create in the reader nothing but a big yawn, and maybe some spicy gossip, but hardly banishment, and hardly the necessity to wear a badge of courage sewn on your dress. Except maybe today one would advertise that status and place a video on ""YouTube"". And that is my moral point.Hester Prynne did not deserve the social opprobrium of the religious fundamentalists of her day. But old Hawthorne did a great service by creating a masterpiece to point out that moral ambiguity and dilemma back in the days."
B000NDLQMU,"Truck, a Love Story",,A1WA3Q5Q3XCNYU,Walt Eddy,0/1,3.0,1346457600,"Is the title of this book TRUCK, A LOVE STORY a little hokey, maybe even manipulative?","This is a review of TRUCK, A LOVE STORY by Michael Perry.Don't you think the title of this book TRUCK, A LOVE STORY seems a little hokey, maybe even manipulative? It's as if its author -- or more likely, the book's editor/publisher, who most often does the naming -- wanted to broaden the book's market appeal. How many women would read a book titled TRUCK? How many men would read A LOVE STORY (setting aside that old romance novel by Eric Segal, which was made into a movie)? However, I guess it could be said that this particular book appeals to broader audiences than those just enamored of a particular vehicle or of touchy-feely stories of romance and love.Well, all of that is beside the point. The book is good, worth reading whether you're a male or female or somewhere in between. Michael Perry writes well, even if it seems sometimes he has too much on his mind. I happened to read this with a book club comprised primarily of women. They generally outnumber the men in the group three or four to one. Many of the books we read could be considered more or less feminine oriented and sometimes I've even heard the women themselves utilize the term chick lit. Because they outnumber the men so far this is the dynamic we men in the group have to live with. But truthfully, we cover a broad swath of interesting fiction and nonfiction, mostly fiction, which brings me to this book.Is TRUCK, A LOVE STORY fiction or nonfiction? It reads like a memoir, but I never did really see anywhere where it claims to be nonfiction. Perhaps, Michael Perry realizes that imaginations always figure into memories and experiences anyway. (The author after all writes, ""Fortunately, the eye is an organ capable of deception. In collusion with the brain, it convinces you to ignore what you see -- or don't see.) Or perhaps I just missed where it says what it is.This is a slow reading piece, a work you want to take your time with, a book you might start reading in bed at night if you want to go to sleep. Now I don't mean by that to say that it is boring or anything derogatory. But don't compare it with today's fast-paced fare, which seems targeted at hyperactivity disordered readers. This isn't calculated to keep you on the edge of your seat, shrieking, or covering your eyes in order to cope. Instead it'll make you want to languish like you are in the Bahamas on the beach with unlimited time and plenty of food and drink by your side with the most charming companion.Where does a truck come in to all of this? Perry is restoring an old International Harvester truck with his brother. The restoration ticks off the time in the book. Perry's attitude is communicated in this manner: ""In 1951, a man bought a pickup truck because he needed to blow things up and move them. Things like bricks and bags of feed. Somewhere along the line trendsetters and marketers got involved, and now we buy pickups -- big, horse-powered, overbuilt, wide-assed, comfortable pickups -- so that we may stick our key in the ignition of an icon, fire up an image, and drive off in a cloud of connotations. I have no room to talk. I long to get my International running in part so I can drive down roads that no longer exist.""Who is Perry? He describes himself: ""At thirty-eight, I'm still a few follicles from a Category Cue Ball."" This is one of his obsessions, besides his truck. He says, ""I was raised in a fundamentalist Christian sect that not only frowned on vanity but viewed long hair on a man as sinful."" He also describes himself as follows: ""No matter our vocation, we so often find ourselves living life as a form of triage. I need more time with the dirt, the sense of the soil with its plenty."" So gardening is another of his -- I don't want to say obsessions -- passions.Family is another honored subject for the author. Speaking of his grandmother, he says ""this time she raised five children of her own and took in another twenty-eight foster children. She did her baking with a .22 rifle at hand and was known to step away from the stove to snipe feral cats and once an incautious woodchuck.""And what of the love story part of the title? Well, there is Anneliese. But I can't say more without spoiling it for you, so I'll shut up and just recommend that you pick up the book, especially if you appreciate a good turn of word in the lathe of literature. If you like anecdotes stacked within the framework of car restoration and raising turnips while discovering a love interest, then find a beach in the South Pacific or Caribbean and languish away with TRUCK, A LOVE STORY in hand."

1584792965,Alton Brown's Gear for Your Kitchen,,A3QKMC6D9IY6Y4,Conway Yen,3/3,4.0,1235606400,"Interesting, but not definitive","Here, Alton attempts to assemble a definitive guide to what you should or shouldn't have in your kitchen.Alton Brown has been described as a kitchen ""hacker,"" kind of like a computer hacker. He's known for his clever solutions to common cooking problems -- his homemade smoker (made out of a wooden or cardboard box) and his ceramic roaster (made out of large terra cotta flower pots) are probably some of his proudest and best known creations.The problem with this book is that it's a fairly subjective book, based on Alton's personal experience and opinion. Additionally, contrary to Alton's trademark style, the book is NOT filled with clever shortcuts or innovative usages of hardware items in the home kitchen -- his ""hacks"". For the most part, dedicated fans of his Food Network show, Good Eats, already know most or all of his tricks. The book doesn't really introduce anything new.Also, the book is somewhat dated, since newer technologies and gear have rendered parts of this book less than totally relevant (e.g. the section on knives. Knives are now made with newer materials that the book does not even mention).Some of the gear listed is difficult to track down (F. Dick Multicut honing steel, certain other specific makes and models of various items or appliances), some of it is shamelessly expensive (the previously mentioned honing steel is $108.00 on Amazon.com), and some items are probably not worth the price when compared to less expensive alternatives that do the job satisfactorily.To be fair, Alton does indicate when certain goods cost more than the average cook might like to spend; however, he also suggests that readers buy some of the higher end goods on the market. The message can seem a bit muddied and contradictory when he favors a big cast iron skillet (at or around $10) while also suggesting that home cooks get a good, clad fry pan (~$180) and a clad saute pan (~$220).Luckily, most of his advice seems to be solid, in my personal opinion. In general, he gives good descriptions of some of his favorite items and why you should try to acquire them if you can. Unfortunately, too many of these items are on the pricy side.But please don't take this guide to be definitive in any way. Use it as a reference and remember that new gear is constantly coming out and replacing old gear. Some of it is garbage. Some of it is gold. Your best bet is to try some of it out, and to do a little research before plunking down some cash for a shiny new toy. Your wallet will thank you (maybe) later."

1847026567,Barchester Towers (Large Print),36.9,A369VS3F6SQMKB,John Martin,2/2,5.0,1230768000,An overlooked gem,"Anthony Trollope, like Miniver Cheevy, was born at the wrong time and in the wrong place. Nineteenth century England produced some of the greatest novelists the world has ever known--Dickens, Austin, the Bronte sisters, Hardy, etc. In this company Trollope has been somewhat lost and that is unfortunate. His books are interesting and filled with humor, pathos and the stuff of life. They are also literate (Trollope was especially versed in the Greeks and Shakespeare), full of good humor and provide lessons for life. It is clear from the limited number of reviews on Amazon.com that Trollope is not widely read. It is equally clear from the mostly positive results that he is a good writer who should get more attention.Barchester Towers is the second of the six books in the Barsetshire series. The books run in historical sequence but can be read independently. The first in the series, The Warden, tells of Mr. Harding and his younger daughter, Eleanor. Rev. Harding is forced to resign as the warden (a kind of manager/minister) of a hospital for elderly men because the salary is too high. He is exposed by John Bold, a reformer, and a local newspaper. But Harding is a good man and he accepts the situation gracefully; his daughter, in fact, marries Bold who then dies but leaves his widow well off financially and with a baby boy.Barchester Towers picks up the story at that point and switches the focus to another group of largely religious individuals. It should be noted that the novel is not about religion as much as it is about power. On the other hand it would be a good idea to know something about the Church of England, such as what the various religious titles represent (archdeacon, dean, vicar, prebendary, etc.), as well as the attitude of the two political parties (Whigs and Tories) toward religion.At the start of the novel the bishop of Barchester dies and a new bishop, Dr.Proudie, is appointed in his place. Proudie is a short, indecisive man who is dominated by his wife. He picks Obadiah Slope as his second in command. Slope is reminiscent of Dickens' sly, scheming Uriah Heep. His objective is to be the de facto bishop, a position that Mrs. Proudie aspires to in her own way as well. Set against this trio are the local Barchester clergy led by Archdeacon Grantly. The recently deceased bishop was the archdeacon's father and the son hoped to succeed to the office. The ambitious Grantly takes an instant dislike to the officious Mr. Slope and their rivalry is one of the main focuses of the bookA number of other characters and sub-plots suffuse the novel. The Stanhope family--mother, father, two daughters and son, soon arrive on the scene. This group includes Madeline, a beautiful but physically impaired young woman who toys with men's affections and Bertie, a shiftless but essentially decent young man. Also joining the cast is the Rev. Mr. Arabin, brought in by the archdeacon to help combat Mr. Slope. The other major plot is the efforts of three men to secure the hand of the widow Eleanor Bold. Slope is one schemer who is primarily intent on securing her money. Bertie Stanhope, the irresponsible prodigal son in the Stanhope family is also encouraged to marry her for her fortune. Finally there is Mr. Arabin, a decent man, but inexperienced in matters of love. Early in the book (page 112) Trollope enters the story to reassure the reader that ""It is not destined that Eleanor shall marry Mr. Slope or Bertie Stanhope."" This tactic, engaged in by other British writers (Fielding for example) can be irritating, but Trollope does it in a good humored way.The central power struggle involves who shall be appointed to the Warder position which has now been restructured. The archdeacon pulls for Mr. Harding to be reappointed, while Mrs. Proudie pumps for the Rev. Mr. Quiverful who has a wife and 14 children to look after and needs the income the job will provide. Mr. Slope slides between the two contenders, depending on how he sees his advantage. When another position opens up, that of Dean, the stakes get even higher.The novel reaches a climax at a party given by an elderly matron, Miss Thorne. Eleanor's two ill suited suitors make their pitch, Trollope's caution to the reader comes true, and the novel proceeds to a happy ending for almost everyone.A final comment. I read a news report recently that president-elect Obama will stop reading novels and spend more time in the gym because of what he sees as the increased demands on his new job. That is, in my view, a big mistake. Novels give us insights into how to live our own lives and we are all better off for reading them. For example in Barchester Towers there is a scene between Archdeacon Grantly and Mr. Williams in which Mr. Williams has received a letter from Mr. Slope for his daughter. Both men object to Slope both as an individual and especially as a suitor for Eleanor. The archdeacon gets very angry and says that Eleanor has disgraced him and that if she marries Slope he will not have anything further to do with her. Mr. Williams, on the other hand, while equally distressed at the prospects of his daughter marrying Slope, says that he will accept that choice and continue his relationship with her. Here we have a clear difference in character. The archdeacon will only have friendship with people who agree with his views--much as George Bush's comment after 9/11, ""you are with us or you are against us."" But we can't live in a world like that. We have to live as Mr. Williams suggests, by accepting that other people can have different views from our own. So lets hope Obama spends less time on the treadmill and more time on Trollope!"
0679642250,The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (Modern Library),,A2OPBCF28QTARX,Stewart Teaze,5/5,5.0,1156291200,The Ultimate Classic Collection of Short Stories,"Following are brief reviews of each of the excellent collection of twelve original Sherlock Holmes short stories that Arthur Conan Doyle published in a newspaper serial in the 1890's:Scandal in Bohemia **** - Fun story. Holmes makes use of his disguises and acting talents to almost reel in a smart and tricky woman, who has acquired means to blackmail the future King of Bohemia.The Red-Headed League **** - Another Fun story. But the crooks could have gotten away with their plan by simply continuing to operate The Red-Headed League until after they finished their criminal activities.A Case of Identity **** - A woman is jilted at the altar, and a mystery ensues. Nobody ends up murdered or physically hurt in this story - just a serious case of a broken heart, with money as the motive.Boscombe Valley Mystery ***** - Top-notch Holmes mystery involving blackmail, murder, secrets, and romance. This story does not seem dated at all; and, if you replaced the carriages with automobiles, could have taken place last week in any small rural town in England or America.The Five Orange Pips **** - Skullduggery involving an ex-Confederate Colonel, and the KKK. Somewhat spooky, but the motive for the murders is a bit shaky, and the ending a bit loose.The Man with the Twisted Lip ***** - Holmes disguises himself as an opium smoker to help get to the bottom of the disappearance of an affluent father. The story involves all sorts of unsavory characters and situations - Victorian London's East Side was not so different from the inner city of any large modern Metropolis.The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle **** - A short Christmas story of thievery and intrigue, involving a goose and a jewel.The Adventure of the Speckled Band *** - Good mystery, but not accurate on details... after reading on the Internet how many technical errors this story has, it hard to give it too high a rating. This case involves murders, for the express goal of monetary gain.The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb **** - One of the shorter adventures and spookier than normal; Holmes solves the mystery and thwarts the criminals' continuing their counterfeiting, but the good-hearted bad guy sidekicks and their murderous leader end up fleeing the scene of the crime before they can be apprehended.The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor **** - A little too far-fartched, this story does have a lot of interesting situations... one is that there are a lot of Americans in it, and another is that Holmes says that he believes England and America will eventually form a ""world-wide country"".The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet **** - Decent story. First time that Holmes seems to use the phrase ""when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"".The Adventure of the Copper Beeches ***** - More rural skulduggery. This very believable tale rivals THE ENGINEER'S THUMB for spookiness.These stories are all now in the public domain; hence the multiple versions distributed by various publishers. These stories are also available from various sources on the Internet."

B000L6OCHK,The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy,,A29M5DKZ713KLE,Pierre Gauthier,1/2,3.0,1308873600,Unusual . . .,"This novel has the length of a Victorian work but both its vocabulary and subject matter are not at all puritan. Themes discussed include for instance intra-uterine baptism and accidental circumcision!The running joke is that the reporter constantly digresses from his digressions and seems incapable of ever getting to his point. In this pseudo-autobiographical work, the narrator's birth finally happens only a good fourth into the book! Presumably, the intent is to be comical but the result is rather silly and even tedious to a modern reader.Published in nine volumes in the 1760's, the novel definitely appears unstructured. It ends without any true conclusion and one feels that many more volumes could have been written and published. Anyhow, there is no plot as such and, despite the title, little is actually learned about Tristram Shandy and his life. The main characters are really his father, a superficial man with very set preconceived notions on a whole series of subjects, and his rather pathetic and anti-social uncle, marked by his war injury _ in the groin!The author succeeds in being very original in a variety of ways: by very frequently addressing the reader, by limiting some chapters to a single sentence and even including blank ones, by making very long quotations in French and Latin or long pointless lists such as the number of streets in each of the various Paris neighbourhoods, etc.Overall, this book can only be recommended to those interested in the history of the British novel with a marked curiosity for atypical 18th century works."

I don't really care about Sylvia or Ted, but Anderson can write rings around most others: an authentic voice, vocabulary that makes my dictionary a necessity (like Thomas Wolfe's ""Of Time and the River"") but not in a pedantic way. You can fall in love with the English language again here, because it is in the hands of a master. Descriptions so well-crafted.This haunting, intricate novel captures the times, places, and people in a startling new perspective, and I lived through the 60's by the way."

Brick,0/0,3.0,976752000,The simplest challenging book I have ever read,"The Red Badge of Courage is a tricky little anti-war book. Crane's language is very simple - appropriate for eighth-graders, mixed with far more challenging dialect. The story is at once obvious and chaotic - a metaphor for the war it depicts. The settings are depicted in the same manner, with a mix of fine detail and battle-obscured backdrops.The story's protagonist, Henry Fleming, is a mixed bag as well. His mental evolution through his first battles is the main thrust of the book, and is every bit as challenging and chaotic as the situations as he finds himself in.This is a book you really have to dig into in order to find the gems - a superficial reading will not suffice. The language is plain, while the story difficult to follow but not particularly novel. The worth of the book is contained in its metaphor, which appears at several levels, but has to be actively searched for. If this style of reading is for you, this is an excellent book. If you read for information or straightforward entertainment, there are plenty of better things to do with your time."

He writes well and explains economic facts lucidly to a layman. However, his forecasting is poor at best. He has been forecasting US stock market crash for last twelve years and nothing happened. On the contrary, stock market is reaching higher and higher. Anybody who followed his advice of avoiding real estate and stock market investment has lost large sums of money over these years and Batra is liable for that with his misleading advice. If he reads this, as a minimum courtesy to the reader he should return the price of the book. Whenever there is stock market volatility, he publishes another book with essentially same information and a new crash date (tickling our fear nerve) in order to make money for himself, not to save us from the impending disaster. Economic cycles are well known and relatively regular throughout history, what is new here is Batra's regular cycle of regurgitation to impose historical determinism on the dismal science."
0195169166,Fallen Blue Knights: Controlling Police Corruption (Studies in Crime and Public Policy),38.89,AOPR7VY5SFMYH,Big Blue 6,3/4,2.0,1276905600,B+ term paper,"The author has done a nice job of describing the work, findings, and recommendations of a few of the major investigative commissions that have been formed to address large-scale corruption in large U.S. police departments (e.g., New York, Philadelphia). The commissions she most often cites did their work in the 1970s and 80s, so there are real questions about whether the information is useful today. But if you're looking for a primer on some of the larger investigative commissions, this book may be useful to you; if you're looking for anything else, keep looking.This book is really just a lengthy college term paper. It might be worth a B+ if a college junior had written it, but it was written by a professor (yikes). The book is long on assertions but short on citations/research to back them up (I suspect much of the author's research involved watching cop movies). The Utopian solution proposed by the author probably looks really good to someone sitting on a college campus. But in the real world it's unworkable, if not outright silly. And contrary to the assertions of the back cover reviews, the author offers very little information about the causes of police corrutpion or it's cures. I'll probably avoid reading anything written by Heymann, Moore, or Shearing just based on their horribly inaccurate reviews of this book (I'm guessing they reviewed it without reading it). But, although the book lacks much useful information, the writing itself is actually good - it's clear and organized.The bottom line: If you're an internal affairs investigator, a police manager, a mayor, a city commissioner, or a member of the public interested in police corruption, there is nothing in this book for you. If you're a college professor or student looking to cite a poorly-researched book about commissions that investigated police corruption in the 1970s, this is your book."

0385403062,Sugar Street,,A2B21POKQ3N09H,David J. Gannon,10/12,5.0,1016409600,Unique window into Arabic culture and Arabic weltanschauung.,"I do consulting in the refining and petrochemical industries and have, as a result, struck up several friendships with Arabs and Arab-Americans working in those facilities. Once I asked several acquaintances if there were are well-regarded Arab writers with good English translations available that could help me as an American better understand the modern Arab experience and worldview. Several recommended The Cairo trilogy (Palace Walk, Palace of Desire, Sugar Street) by Naguib Mahfouz. It covers a time period that would provide an excellent overview into 20th century Arab experience both politically and socially, especially vis-&agrave;-vis Arab/Western interaction. It is a family saga and therefore provides a good view of modern Arab family life and the affects modernization has had on it. It's urban setting and action would be more familiar to Americans than a more rural tale. The books are written from a genuinely Arabic sensibility language-wise-a sensibility not overly degraded by translation. And, finally, it would be a ""less difficult"" introduction to Arabic culture than other possibilities.It should be noted that ""less difficult"" is not that same as ""easy"" or ""easier"". This marks an important distinction, one underscored by these books. Arabic language, society and sensibilities are colored much more by nuances and multiple permutations on a few basic themes than is true in Western society.Naguib Mahfouz is a Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian novelist who adeptly and adroitly captures these nuances and evokes a genuine feel for-if not true understanding of-their intrinsic roots within the Arabic weltanschauung.Clearly, based on the reviews to date for this book, there are many who have difficulty with this dynamic. These are the folks who probably are unable to split hairs and see the distinction between ""less difficult"" and ""easier"". If you are that sort of person I have to say quite honestly that you are going to be both frustrated and bored by this book or any of the series.If you are the sort who relishes a challenge, truly wants to try to get a feel for and understand Arabic social and political views and don't mind putting a bit of effort into that undertaking, you will find reading any or all of these books a rewarding experience indeed."

Probably not.It's the home of Travis McGee, ""knight in tarnished armor,"" and central character of theover-20 volumed series by John D. MacDonald.With quite a following of readers around the world (my first McGee was whilevacationing in Torremolinas years ago and needing something to read while soaking up theSpanish sunshine and absorbing the sangria deliciosa!), MacDonald's hero, along with hissometimes bizarre assortment of friends, enemies, and hangers-on, goes from one adventureto another. Each of the McGee books contains a color in the title, easily recognizable. Andit's not purple prose either! MacDonald, a best-selling novelist for years, has more thanjust a storyline to carry his books.Certainly, McGee is his principal concern. He's ""retired"" most of the time--heonly goes back to work when he sees he's running out of money. He'd rather stay aboardhis houseboat and entertain his friends that work. He claims he's taking his retirement oneday at a time!""The Deep Blue Good-by"" is the first in this series, published in 1964. It is amazing,too, that in reading it here in the year 2000, the book still stands as relevant now as it wasthen. McGee, as usual, finds himself befriending and then helping out Cathy Kerr, whohas come to him in desperation. Her misfortune has been to meet up with Junior Allen, ""asmiling, freckle-face stranger"" with depravity on his mind and a more odious person youdon't want to meet. There is also something about missing inheritance. McGee is unableto resist and from the moment he accepts the challenge, the reader is glued to the pages.MacDonald's style is terse (some would say Hemingwayesque--one of MacDonald's favoritewrites, incidentally) and moves rapidly, a pace easy to keep up with but one that if youblink, you might miss something. But who wants to blink when MacDonald ison a McGee crusade! The author's knack for piercing characterization, his ability tocapture the landscape and atmosphere of ""Lauderdamndale,"" and his penchant for a goodstory make this first episode one not to be missed. True, the McGee books ordinarily don'thave to be read in sequence, it's still a good idea. Over the course of the series, naturally,an affinity toward complete understanding of Travis, and his good friend Meyer, keepsreaders truly involved.""The Deep Blue Good-by"" is a ""hello"" to a great series!"

I saw nothing in MissAnn's review that deserved the attack she received from Jennifer R. And for the record, I would never break previous plans with a good friend just because my boyfriend called me at the last minute, not out of any manipulation or game playing, but simply because that's not what good friends do to each other. And that's not what a man who really loves you expects you to do. It's really pretty much that simple. All the fussing and fighting over it all is pretty silly.I suppose you could say it's all a matter of degrees. There's a fine line between standing up for yourself and just plain being bitter and hateful. You can take it too far, and I don't ever recommend game playing, but it has been my experience from observing what many other women, men truly do take ""nice"" women for granted. I wish I had a dollar bill for every time I've seen a man take a sweet, devoted girl who would do anything for him and cheat on her, lie to her, take advantage of her, break her heart and not even care, only to turn around and fall head over heels with a woman who lives her own life, isn't always available whenever he wants to see her, and basically doesn't let him jerk her around.

The book's target audience is mainly skinny males ages 13-35 who want to get ripped, because the book shows you the most efficient way known to man how to put on lean muscle mass, in a relatively short period of time - without using steroids. In fact, I gained more muscle in the 4 months doing the Scrawny to Brawny program than guys with a similar build to me who did steroids for 4 months.I do not think however that the book is only for males ages 13-35. The book is divided into two sections, exercise/training and nutrition. The exercise/training explains the most effective way through training the body can put on muscle/lose fat/generally be healthy. Likewise, the nutrition part does the exact same thing. The thing is these concepts are targeted towards males 13-35, but they apply to everyone, regardless of age, or sex.S2B does not include any fad dieting or exercises. It implements methods that have been tried and tested over time, tbat actually work. Olympic athletes have used it, and it works for them - just as well as it did for me.I'll be brunt though. It is hard work. There are no short cuts, or cheap methods. The hardest part is just eating healthy foods 6-9x a day. The work outs are relatively short, but intense as hell."

And she did a fantastic job doing it.Nobody can say that Ms. Rule isn't a talented writer or that this book isn't fascinating, gripping reading.I'm fascinated by Ted . I think I always will be. No other serial killer has ever held my interest and attention like he has.And I know that that thousands of others feel the same way.I normally read fast but it took me over a week to finish this because I could only take so much of the subject matter at once.I just finished it a few hours ago and I feel deeply shaky and emotional right now.I feel horror,disbelief,and extreme sadness for everyone involved here, but especially for both Ted and his victims.The whole thing is a complete, utter tragedy from start to end.How sad that so many young women were taken in the very prime of life,and how sad that Ted , a man with so much potential , was driven by an uncontrollable, compulsive mental sickness to kill them.Its also wrenching that so many of the girls were never found and were never able to have a final resting place other than wherever they were dumped at.I like almost everyone who has ever heard about these killings wish that it had never happened and that both Ted and the victims were still out there alive, living happy anonymous lives.As much as I like the book, there are a few things I'd like to mention:On the night before Ted's execution,Ann bitterly thinks to herself that she doesn't owe Ted anything. I have to disagree.I'd say that Ann owes Ted a great deal when it comes down to it.As much as I know that Ann was grieved and sickened by these murders and the fact that they were done by someone she considered a friend and as much as I know that she'd give everything up to have had none of it ever happen, the fact is that this book made her career.Ann was always a talented crime writer, but the fact that she knew Ted Bundy and has such a fascinating ,insider track in which to write a book about him with, made her career.It plucked her out of obscurity to become a hugely popular and successful true crime writer.Without Ted Bundy, I doubt that she would have achieved this level of success.I disgree with Ann's support of the death penalty, but I give her credit for not celebrating the execution and condeming the revelers outside the prison who did.Finally, its very hard to get a grip on how Ann actually feels about Ted now.The events in this book stretched for almost 30 years total(longer now,but 2000 was the last update},so of course her feelings changed over time.Even in later years though, her feelings seem to waffle.Sometimes she seems to almost hate him and says that she had kept hoping for a long time that the interest in Ted would die down, so she'd never have to think about him again.At other times, even though she denounces him as a psychopath who had no conscience and could have never been cured, sometimes she seems to retain some tenderness for him.Maybe she herself is still conflicted deep down about her feelings.In closing, Mrs.Rule does an excellent job in bringing to life many of the young women who were Ted's victims.I found many things out about them and their lives that I didn't know.Its always nice to see a portrait painted of someone instead of them just being a name and number on a victims list."

The price might have been justified had this been a glossy, photo-packed book, but seems ludicrous given that it is merely a collection of 17 essays. The essays dwell on four major areas of contemporary J-Pop Culture: music, manga and animation, TV &amp; film and the popularity of J-Pop Culture outside of the country. It comes as little surprise that Mark Schilling's contribution, about the Tora-san character in the Otoko wa Tsurai yo (It's Tough Being a Man) film series, is the most interesting - not necessarily because of the topic, but because Schilling is the only contributor who is a writer of any repute. The majority of these essays are written by academics and it shows: footnotes abound, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers get analysed to the nth degree and claims are made that &quot;Sailor Moon's rearrangement of the traditional superhero myth bears hints of not only a new social order, but also the kind of moral struggles, alliances, and identities that may create and accompany it.&quot; The book also contains a number of confidence-sapping factual errors (example: Osaka band Shonen Knife &quot;started playing in the mid-1980s&quot; which is not true, they started playing in December 1981). Schilling's Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture (Weatherhill) remains the definitive starting point for those seeking a good, accessible introduction to the subject; Japan Pop! is only for the otaku completist, and a wealthy one at that."

Well-researched accounts about life during the pandemic fill the first chapters of the book. Gripped by the story, I read on eagerly into all hours of the night waiting for the chapter on the investigation of the miners bodies sealed in the permafrost I had followed carefully on the news.As I finished that account, I became concerned; I was almost out of pages and the author had yet to draw the story together. But I pressed on and found that the story just suddenly stopped; as if she had run out of material or energy.Clearly there are no conclusions about the 1918 pandemic at this time, but I would have expected the author to do a better job summarizing the story; perhaps at least a summary of what little we do know. But Gina Kolata quickly wraps up her book and leaves the reader hanging. It really feels like she just got tired and gave up.It is an okay book and will remain in my permanent library. But it could have been so much better if she had written the second half.UPDATE: I recently re-read this book and have lowered my rating to two stars. The book ""just stops""."

Unfortunately, I found that reading Foundation's Fear was a laborious exercise. The author seems to struggle reconciling the scientific concepts initialized by Isaac Asimov with his own concepts of physics. The entire dialogue between Voltaire and Joan was particularly difficult to wade through, only to discover that this part of the story line had very little to do with the development of the rest of the book. I understand that some ideas had to be set up for the next two books, but I was frustrated by the sense that this book just didn't have a reason for being other than the commercial success guaranteed by the &quot;Foundation&quot; title. Given a choice between buying this book or rereading any of the original Foundation titles, this reviewer would recommend revisiting Mr. Asimov's authentic classics."

Authors take readers beyond political, cultural, and geographic perspectives of fundamental Christian history. This work makes a strong defense for Sanneh&#8217;s theory of &#8216;Christian translatability across cultures&#8217; that Christianity is a global development and not just as a European arm. In this work the authors have recognized women&#8217;s involvement and contribution in the entire process of Christian expansion, which is an encouraging aspect for women in missionary enterprise. Women have played a vital role in the translation work (Vulgate) than people would generally imagine.Reading through the book one may notice redundant verbatim between sections, which is not bad (maybe, more beneficial for non-western readers to keep themselves on track). The authors also draw conclusions at the end of each chapter which help readers on the story line. Irwin and Sunquist&#8217;s overall arrangement of the history of Christianity in this volume is very helpful for those who want to learn about church history from a wide variety of perspectives and draw inspirations from what God has done in history by men and women who were obedient to His call."

I say ""best,"" not because it is the most extensive, nor because it is the most detailed coverage of the subject.

Nevertheless knowing theforms and having names to identify them makes it easier to see them in use in the writing of others. By thus making them memorable, they also become a more ready part of one's writing toolkit.The engaging and entertaining style which Quinn uses throughout the book makes even the most daunting technical terms readily accessible. His well-chosen examples are also entertaining and informative, and most are quite memorable.

It is the story of Billy Pilgrim and his problematic life marred by his horrific experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden during World War II. There, Billy experiences firsthand the catastrophic fire bombing that leveled the German city. The reader jumps back and forth to different points in Billy's life, many times randomly and unexpectedly. All of it adds up to a darkly (yet humorously) told story of a sad, existentialist life.I must say that I, as a Believer, have a different worldview than Kurt Vonnegut and Billy Pilgrim. But this book is so very honest about what everyday human life must mean if there is nothing more than fire bombings, dogs barking, family members, dreams of trips to imaginary planets, and so on. If what we see is all there is, as many of us, with our actions and beliefs testify to frequently, well then, as Vonnegut writes, &quot;...so it goes.&quot; The only thing we can do to cope is deny the fact and create our own subversions, unless we truly want to open ourselves up to something our very nature tells us from which to run.&quot;So..&quot; said Billy gropingly, &quot;I suppose that the idea of preventing wwar on Earth is stupid, too.&quot;&quot;Of course.&quot;&quot;But you do have a peaceful planet here.&quot;&quot;Today we do.

Translated into Modern English by Nevill Coghill. 504 pp. Penguin Classics. ISBN : 0140440224 (pbk.)Nevill Coghill's brilliant modern English translation of Chaucer's masterpiece, 'The Canterbury Tales,' has always been a bestseller and it's easy to understand why. Chaucer was an intensely human writer and a great comic artist, but besides the ribaldry and sheer good fun of tales such as 'The Miller's Tale,' we also know he was capable of other things. His range was wide, and the striking thing about Coghill's translation is how amazingly faithful it is to the spirit of the original - at times bawdy and hilariously funny, at other times more serious and moving when Chaucer shifts to a more poignant mode.But despite the brilliance of Coghill's translation, a translation so effective that it was even made into a successful musical, and despite the fact that it remains the best possible introduction to Chaucer for those who don't know Middle English, those who restrict themselves to Coghill are going to miss a lot - such readers are certainly going to get the stories, but they're going to lose much of the beauty those stories have in the original language. The difference is as great as that between a black-and-white movie and technicolor.Chaucer's Middle English _looks_ difficult to many, and I think I know why. It _looks_ difficult because that in fact is what people are doing, they are _looking_ at it, they are reading silently and trying to take it in through the eye. This is a recipe for instant frustration and failure. But fortunately there is a quick and easy remedy.So much of Chaucer's power is in the sheer music of his lines, and in their energy and thrust. He was writing when English was at its most masculine and vigorous. And his writings were intended, as was the common practice in the Middle Ages when silent reading was considered a freakish phenomenon, to be read aloud. Those new to Chaucer would therefore be well advised, after reading and enjoying Nevill Coghill's rendering, to learn how to read Middle English _aloud_ as soon as possible by listening to one of the many excellent recordings (one of the best is by Robert Ross on Caedmon).Coghill certainly captures the spirit of Chaucer, but modern English cannot really convey the full flavor and intensity of the original. Learn how to roll a few of Chaucer's Middle English lines around on your tongue and you'll soon hear what I mean. You'll also find that it isn't nearly so difficult as it _looks_, and your pleasure in Chaucer will be magnified enormously."

It is clear from the Cardinal as it was from my experience with my own father that even when you think you are at your darkest human hour you need to reach out and make a difference every single day until your final moment in this part of your journey here on earth.This book is a must read for anyone who has doubted that there is peace in death. He reconfirms that the lessons most important in life are to continue to give of yourself every day despite the adversities you face. In his illness, through his false accusation and his wonderful rediscovery of a deeper faith in Christ it makes accepting God's plan for you important.Anyone who has an ill parent or someone close to them should read this book it will give you a much clearer spiritual understanding of illness, death and living every moment under God's plan."
1592240003,Doctor Syn: A Smuggler Tale of the Romney Marsh,12.44,A1GZKHEQWTS4Z5,Thomas Moody,34/42,2.0,1061424000,Underwhelming start of a legendary story...,"For many childern of the 60's (myself included), the Sunday evening TV episodes of &quot;The World of Disney&quot; exposed adolescents (as well as many &quot;adult adolescents&quot;) to a diverse catalouge of entertaining adventure tales. In 1965, a three-part episode entitled &quot;Dr. Syn, the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; first aired and enthralled all who watched it. The &quot;robin hood&quot; atmosphere that this work evoked drove many to want more of the &quot;Scarecrow&quot; to the extent that some of these &quot;children&quot; never got over that desire (me included again, of course). This interest was again recently peaked for me when I watched it on VHS with my own children and subsequently was driven to (happily) discover that the &quot;Dr. Syn&quot; story indeed had a long history.Russell Thorndyke (an English actor/playwrite of the early 20th century) was the impetus for the story, I discovered, and wrote a number of short novels that ultimately spawned the Disney film. While researching these works, I discovered this fairly new release and decided to indulge. When I received it, I found that this particular volume &quot;Dr Syn, a Smuggler Tale of Romney Marsh&quot; is a re-release of the original 1915 story that started the legend, so, with memories of the film in mind, I dove into reading it. Sadly, this initial telling of the story doesn't nearly match the film or the legend that we're all familiar with and is thus a disappoinment.The storyline, of course, is of Dr. Syn, the mild-mannered vicar of Dymchurch who's alter-ego is the Scarecrow...that mysterious, masked night-rider who heads a band of smugglers intent on making life in Romney Marsh palatable for the townsfolk during the late 1700's. Their swashbuckling adventures keep the village economically above water while at the same time tweeking the rouge English government of King George. Outlaws as they are, the characters are heroic (as all &quot;rob from the rich and give to the poor&quot; types are) and amazingly clever as attempt after attempt to capture them further embellishes their reputation.This book by Thorndyke establishes the characters and setting, while filling in some blanks. We are told that Syn is in fact a Captain Clegg, the notorious pirate who was thought hanged years ago, but is now the kindly vicar. He now resides in Dymchuch and soon becomes stagnated by country life and disillusioned by the repeated efforts of the English government to stay economically viable (read, taxing them to death). Syn becomes the Scarecrow and recruits a gang of smugglers who work with other European countries to obtain illegal booty which ultimately keeps the Dymchurch province afloat. The problem with this book, however, is that very little is discussed about these &quot;high adventure&quot; activities and too many nonsensical storylines are established that detract from the essence of the main theme. One is left to assume a lot here and, I suspect, many will lose patience (admittedly, I did). This book isn't great writing nor great literature, so the draw of this work should have been the character of the Scarecrow. Unfortunately (and I assume that Thorndyke enhances the story in subsequent novels) we see very little of the Scarecrow and still less of the &quot;midnight rides&quot;. I suppose that the main problem here is the fact that we've now seen the movie and are all too familiar with the characters. Therefore we've missed the buildup of the story from 1915 to now and our expectations get soundly thrashed when reading this work.I do plan however to read at least some of the follow-up novels (Thorndyke kills Syn in this volume, so his subsequent works follow Syn as he lives preceding this story) and truly hope that the story's improve. With respect to this work, however, I'd only recommend it for the truly die-hearted."

Fineman who said, ""He generalizes egregiously about topics that are enormous. ... He feels free to judge -- for instance scientists -- outside his field.""I agree that Zinsser does these things, but I disagree that it is a problem. In fact, if I have one criticism of the book it is exactly the opposite: that the lessons are even more generalizable and broadly applicable than Zinsser gives them credit for. For instance, if you skip the travel writing chapter, or if you read it thinking that it only applies to travel writing, then you will miss two golden and persuasive arguments that ought to apply to *any* writer:1) The things that come to the writer easiest -- clich&eacute;, excessive detail, syrupy and vague language -- are the things that keep the reader bored/detached/passive.2) Your main task as a writer is to distill the essence of whatever you're writing about--to find its central idea, to describe its distinctive qualities using precise images. In other words, your main task is to work excruciatingly hard.The goal of any writer (yes, any) ought to be to transform the reader from a passive observer into an ally. It's excruciatingly hard to do, but once you realize that that's the goal, and once you realize that the parts that come easiest are what's getting in the way of that goal, then you can start writing well.Zinsser knows these things, and he articulates them beautifully. It is one of the most persuasive books I have read, on any subject. But I hate that the lessons are hidden within topic-specific chapters. Please read with that in mind."

That's it!"" There are a lot of books out there in that kind of teen-diary/letter format, but Zoe Trope does it in a way that is just... good.I aspire to be a writer, and her opinions and metaphors were a huge inspiration to me. I would find myself saying one more page, one more page, until I had finished the book, and was left disappointed - only because it ended far too quickly.The author's views on love, hate, superiority, distance, and just high school in general were refreshing. I felt like finally, after all these Princess Diaries and the like, someone had published a book from my end of the spectrum.PDKTF is worth however much it costs, whatever age you are, because it's true - and you can't deny the truth."

It can be read, but it's really not a lot of fun. I'm kicking myself for even buying it. Especially after I read the first one and didn't like it at all....Larry Niven is a very good author. Jerry Pournelle is also very good. I am not sure what happened in this book.Again, if you have other choices, they are probably better."

Otherwise, if your expectations are even at the trash fiction level, this book's simplistic style will insult your intelligence. I give it one star for being marketed to serious readers when, really, it's written on an 8th grade level."

There is so much information and food for thought that for every re-read you find something new. The careful reader will notice different layers of information, not everything is spelled out. Because, as I see it, one of the main ideas of the author is to kick start your own thinking and deduction process and slowly ""heat the crucible"" . I've read it twice and I intend to read it again. Who knows what I'll find this time. This is not an easy read, but dealing with the biggest questions of life isn't an easy task and there are no short cuts if you want to get to the bottom of things. Can't recommend this one enough!"

I suggest that readers who have not read this book, do so. This novel is about a pig named Wilbur and a spider named Charlotte. Charlotte does something very memorable at the end of the story. Read this book and you will soon find out the exciting story of Charlotte's Web."

Be forewarned, however, that parts of this book are quite arcane; and without the aid of any footnotes, some if it is very hard to understand. I have no intention of becoming a Dickens scholar. If you're like me, just enjoy it for the alcoholic womanizing romp that it is. Cheerio!"

B000KOAXIU,French Relations,,AOTSPI3S5I48P,"Marissa B ""Marissa""",0/0,4.0,1257033600,"Fun, but loooong read","This book is fun. It involves a young twenty-something, Tash French, who has lost her job and her boyfriend and is on her way to her mother's mansion in France to spend the summer with her eccentric family. There are days by the pool, trips to the farmer's market, and a raucious party that make for a fun summer read. Along the way, Tash is romanced by multiple suitors, some of whom are less than ideal.Tash French is a likable character, if a bit wishy washy. She can't seem to make up her mind about who and what she wants. In spite of this, I found myself rooting for her to get it together.I love makeover stories, and this book had a bit of that element to it. However, it was way too long. At 800 pages, the book could have been cut in half and still made a formidable read. There were too many characters and plot points, and I found myself skipping the sections which revolved around Tash's annoying raver cousin, Marcus. There is a lot of exposition (including far too many dream sequences). After all of the (looong) build-up, you'd expect to get a more satisfying ending. However, it seems to end abruptly without a lot of insight into the happily-ever-after that I tend to expect from chick lit such as this.Despite these foibles, the scenes of French life and lazy days in a chateau in France really made for an escapist read. I recommend the book, but don't expect to devour it in one sitting!"

Combs,4/5,3.0,1279065600,nothing to write home about,I was able to finish this one but it won't stay with me. I didn't feel much of a connection to the characters and wondered if a minister/priest would really get that involved or spend that much time with a married cop she didn't even know in a town she had just moved to. It didn't seem likely to me. I don't think I'll read any more of this series.
